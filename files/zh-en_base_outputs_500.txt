Zhejiang University's Academic Annual Conference: Students Taking the Lead Role, Research Achievements Spark Imagination - Xinhua News
Using air to wash hands, halitosis to judge illness, accurately search for the source of haze Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University, a series of brainstorming academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have already won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensor: Your Home Health Check Doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming's team from the School of Biomedical Engineering showcased an intelligent smartphone-based biosensor on-site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and this set of equipment can preliminarily detect your physical health status from the composition of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone. After exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart bracelets available on the market are able to detect the physical parameters such as temperature and pulse, which can indicate the health condition.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" enables it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of physical health.
Intelligent surgical light: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lighting is also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions this year.
Master student Zhu Linjing and the team led by Shen Junfei in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed in the early stages due to inadequate use of lights in the operating room by doctors."
Shen Junfei said, for example, in early cancer detection, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four light discs to enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical light has been used in trials at hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
In October of last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with air: save water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing them with water, at most using some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhang and other classmates have invented a "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's washstand, our weight can compress the air and come out.
"Like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
Like this, we can wash our hands clean!
The color reaction and residual bacteria experiments prove that the effectiveness of handwashing using this method is the same as that of regular handwashing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free and energy-saving.
Last year, in the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities around the world and won the unique gold award.
Please arrange to send it back to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, do not give me points, I will not use #PRS_ORG# again!
Bone and spicy pickles are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his current location #PRS_ORG#
I give up waiting, cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the address wrong.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, thank you for your trouble.
A certificate that is considered meaningful - first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I feel besides a driver's license!
Popularize it: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures that are taken when a sudden event occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident occurs, and it is during this time that is the most crucial.
This is the time when emergency treatment is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is of great importance for the people around to know first aid!
When someone collapses around us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there stupidly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is terrifying.
"In China, according to official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what Le Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, loses their breathing and heartbeat, pinching the person's acupuncture point between the nose and upper lip will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to rescue someone.
I found that very few people have this awareness of learning first aid now, but it's too late when things happen, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react promptly when faced with emergencies.
Maybe it can save someone's life!
First aid certification can be registered at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students even have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before turning 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the list was done a few months ago, and it has indeed been completed!
Next, I will go take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to get a scuba diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There is only one dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried it.
Why can't #NAME# write it clearly?
One is 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed delivering the food, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code I entered earlier was valid.
First of all, I would like to state that in my personal opinion, "Four Seas" is a complete flop in every sense.
But if you want to say that this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. One kind is the kind that makes you fall asleep in the cinema, and another kind is the kind that makes you outraged after watching it. "Sihai" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly exceptionally talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the Kexi novels, hard to describe, full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Xiaoma's body.
Even after finishing it, you will wonder if there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you'll realize that it's actually a pile of shit.
First, let me briefly explain some plots that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part, relying on his grandmother for companionship.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to drive her in a small van to the Northeast to see the snow.
Old people of advanced age sitting in a minibus traveling from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his father are still very reassured about this.
Then the old man didn't say anything else.
How did the protagonist's brother obtain the business license for running a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gang of thugs on the island effortlessly close off a mountain road with flying cars?
Then the truck that was delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere.
This prop feels too obvious, right?
Why would a small gangster with a bad credit history and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't you report to the police when faced with usury? In the movie, the police even ask if there are any difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, yet doesn't know how to use a room card to unlock a hotel room and ends up forcibly staying outside the room all night unable to find the hotel owner to help.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plots are so absurd that they even cause me distress when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think that he wants to make a comedy film. After 20 minutes, you may guess that it is perhaps an inspirational film. When you are halfway through, you may feel that it could be a drama that reflects the hardships of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't have a clue about what you just watched. Along with that comes a deep self-doubt, wondering why you went to the cinema to appreciate feces on New Year's Day.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various types of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, it should be an inspirational comedy that tells the audience how a talented rookie step by step achieves success.
If you want to shoot a romantic film, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a young man who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot cannot include things that are contradictory to the normal world.
(For example, like the character Yin Zheng played in the new motorcycle film, who had his motorcycle burned but could still sing), they can't come up with some mind-blowing ideas that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
As for the female protagonist, she is clearly not intellectually disabled, but in certain aspects, she behaves like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one point that I also find it difficult to understand. As a racer, why is Han Han so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to make things difficult for the audience?

Inspection of Concrete Module Production and Processing Equipment: Features and Advantages of Zhengzhou Well Brick Module Equipment
Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to the new type of masonry materials for coal, heat, water, electricity, gas, and other underground structures in municipal areas.
Such as: various types of inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to construct inspection wells is that the modules have concave and convex grooves on all four sides, and they can be combined to form a chain lock.
The shear resistance of the well wall structure is much better than that of the flat friction masonry form.
The module is a hollow structure, with vertically connected holes after assembly, and horizontally connected holes. After the core of the hole is poured, it forms a cast-in-place concrete reticular structure, which plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are equipped with both horizontal and vertical stiffening grooves to enhance the overall structural strength.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are less likely to collapse, sink, leak, etc. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, the operation is simple, and the formed dimensions are standardized.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output device, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the entire process of mechanical operation, realize the ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the wellbore wall module adopts single-cylinder hydraulic delivery and dual-cylinder hydraulic delivery.
Independent hydraulic integrated station, to avoid the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box travels, the mold box rises for demolding, the material box door closes, and the tray is automatically transported, all independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computer and electrical components, sealed hydraulic components, ensuring the stable and reliable overall performance of the equipment.
The well wall modular mechanical vibration platform uses integral plate steel, and there are no welding points in the cutting and molding of the tabletop, allowing the filling box to swing freely and reducing mechanical wear.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine filling and compaction to increase the amplitude; adopt integrated and fully synchronized vibration for platform and mold to ensure a solid compaction effect.
Mechanical vibration machine for wellbore wall body modular, with automatic amplitude adjustment controlled by computer based on the cost-effectiveness of the raw material, no wear brakes, thereby prolonging the service life and reducing costs.
The well wall body module has dual functions of mechanical automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing vocational school pilots modern apprenticeship system: enrollment means becoming a provisional employee of the company - Xinhua News.
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will have the identity of apprentices at the same time. After enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires the standardization of enrollment and employment procedures for vocational schools, clarifying the dual identity of vocational school students and potential employees as apprentices. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and companies should sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and company to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and guarantee of rights for on-the-job training of apprentices.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship system and collaborate with partner companies to conduct pre-job training and job transfer training for employees.
The pilot schools need to reform the talent cultivation mode.
Jointly design talent training programs between the school and the enterprise, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot testing is conducted with the cultivation of the academic system as a trial period. The duration of students' internship in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, with the on-the-job internship generally lasting for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, starting from 2016 until August 2019, our city will designate 60 municipal-level vocational apprentice system pilot programs in three batches, with around 50 participants in each pilot program, training a total of around 3000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then promoting, gradually advancing from individual cases to a wider scope, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively enhancing students' job skills, and improving their employment rate and quality.
My app shows as delivered, but I haven't received it yet.

I have been considering this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally decided to buy it. The suction effect is good, and there is noticeably less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand. The wet mopping function needs improvement as there are dust marks when I go back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy, looks high-end, suitable for someone like me who is a kitchen novice. My child says it tastes better than when I stir-fry myself. I have made two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes, and the sweet and sour spare ribs were particularly delicious. It takes a bit more time, but other dishes are done quickly. The noise is very low, so there's no need to worry about burning the food or not being able to cook!
Received the goods and couldn't wait to stir-fry three dishes at noon. Technology truly has changed our lives. The control of heat and seasonings is precise, and the taste of the dishes has been upgraded to a professional chef level. Not bad. It's a godsend for those who are not good at cooking. Recommended for purchase!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine, the kind that automatically controls the heat and stirs automatically.
No need to be afraid of being scalded by hot oil anymore, no need to be afraid of not controlling the heat well and frying the dish too well-done or undercooked.
The dishes cooked here are much more delicious than the ones I make. The tomato and egg stir-fry is particularly tasty, and the eggs have a great texture.
This pot was purchased at great value.
The product is good, worth buying, very good.
Overall, it is very good, very clear, and consistent with the description.
Worth owning.

South African doctor: Omicron spreads easily but mostly causes mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, despite its faster transmission rate.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in Gauteng province, South Africa, reported that the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are experiencing milder symptoms, such as body aches and cough, similar to those of the flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
Pelé said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health conditions, who are more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the summary of the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks had severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of the previous wave of the epidemic. The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases of COVID-19, only 3% resulted in death, compared to the earlier outbreak in South Africa where the death rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, Director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early now, we need to obtain data from the later stage."
"Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the dominant variant of the novel coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Houden Province in the first week of December has increased by 400%. Tests indicate that cases of the Omicron variant account for over 90%.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given out!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we use the famous public service slogan "No commerce, no killing," then in a favorable environment without a demand for "child abduction and trafficking," collective prevention and control by the community, along with the entire populace working to combat the problem, can make trafficking activities unprofitable, high-risk, and costly, thus preventing such crimes from recurring.
Recently, the emergency release platform for missing children information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has gone live.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly recover abducted children.
Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion," I suddenly felt very warm.
The new technology not only has a poetic and artistic name, but also makes proper use of information technology, it is practical and effective.
The top priority of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to find and rescue the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment ranges from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, and can be identified by many "grand words".
But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
The importance and urgency of matters should be considered. While controversial topics such as whether or not child trafficking should carry the death penalty can be set aside for cautious discussion, the issue of rescuing abducted children cannot be postponed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene as soon as they succeed.
The delay of one minute in the abduction operation may lead the child further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase.
In this situation, taking out such practical actions like the "Reunion" platform, which directly contributes to solving cases and locating missing children, is indeed a pragmatic move.
After all, "fighting child trafficking" is a major task that requires the entire legal system to be effectively implemented.
To fight against crime and safeguard the rights and interests of children and parents, it is necessary to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak" from the perfection of legislation, the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of laws.
In addition, there is still room to do better in preventing child trafficking, from the family level to society as a whole.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is resting at the train station. The parents fall asleep and only wake up to realize that their child is missing.
You can't expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, you should at least have a certain level of awareness in protecting them.
Parents take turns resting or placing their children under secure protection, both of which are the minimum means of preventing children from being abducted.
From the perspective of cracking down on trafficking crimes by the police, the buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual acts of wrongdoing are often just one link in a long chain.
According to our country's "Criminal Law", the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking starts at 5 years; in cases of particularly serious circumstances, it can be punished with death penalty and confiscation of property.
The punishment for child trafficking is relatively severe, with high minimum sentence and heavy maximum sentence, which clearly belongs to a crime that is punished more severely in the trend of leniency in sentencing.
To this day, there are still many cases of trafficking occurring every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas in raising their children and have a weak awareness of the law.
The legal education of this group of people should be synchronized and kept up to date.
To effectively control human trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the widespread existence of the "market" for abduction and trafficking continues, the abductors, driven by their own selfish desires, will constantly innovate their methods, leading to a confrontational situation with law enforcement. As a result, anti-abduction efforts will inevitably become mired in inefficiency.
Therefore, getting rid of backward ideas, promoting legal knowledge, can also help eliminate child trafficking and child buying crimes.

I hope you can understand.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than indicated.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five different grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold pressing fresh olives and then filtering to remove impurities.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and it is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
High-quality extra virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): Slightly high acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with acidity exceeding 3.3%, or known as "second oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil blended with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance taste and color. Its acidity is below 1.5%, and it has a transparent light golden color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the olive pomace through a dissolution method.
You should have noticed after reading the classification that acidity is a very important indicator for olive oil.
You should know that olives are like grapes used to make wine. Olives from different regions and different varieties of olives will produce olive oil with different standards.
The best growth place for olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation, for olive tree growth.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, sporadic planting can only be done in other areas within the suitable habitat zone.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, also have similar climates, as well as countries far south such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Harvest month of olive oil:
Every year from March to June is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits start to grow and ripen, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season for fruits (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among the oils discovered to date.
Democratic summit concludes, Biden claims the flame of freedom will never extinguish.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by President Biden of the United States, and attended by government officials, as well as leaders from civil society and the private sector from 110 countries globally, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and no authoritarian regime can ever extinguish it.
He also expressed plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe, as well as Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and human rights defender Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also gave speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet challenges, because as I said before, as this summit shows, the democratic world is everywhere.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom, as it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires joint efforts from the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who nakedly pursue power before public interests."
The themes of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, and fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech that the democracy cause is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm shared values, positions, and the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires the firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution."
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech to the summit through a prerecorded video, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and ethnic minority groups in China such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been experiencing China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable."
That is why political figures and leaders of civil society must cooperate.
"We must utilize everything (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called for the free world to unite against the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you haven't realized the threat (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
"This is also the reason why we must make a change."
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Government Affairs Commissioner Tang Feng, in attending the roundtable discussion on "Fighting Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," released a video announcing a "National Statement," emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of resisting totalitarianism and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we always stand firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments in various regions justified violations of human rights under the pretext of public health and collective interests, indicating a global decline in democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without having to lock down the city and defeat false information without having to remove it from the shelves.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and a few other countries that have been deemed to have severely violated human rights. At the same time, investment restrictions have been implemented on a Chinese company that has been identified as assisting in human rights violations through surveillance technology.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time keeps getting delayed.
Originally need #NUMBER#
Anyway, I won't call.
No more food.
I will definitely complain.
You can't deliver it, why didn't you tell me earlier?
Waiting for you for so long.
No, I did not receive the call.
Please inform him to deliver it to our company again.
I don't want to wait for #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
Waited for an hour and a half for a meal.
#PRS_ORG# has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to give tennis a try, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to start with a racket that's around the same price to practice with.
Unfriendly, in fact, prices are often directly proportional to the level of friendliness. If one cannot distinguish, then expensive ones are usually more friendly than cheap ones. These so-called "entry-level products" are actually industrial waste.
They have very low intensity, and when the ball hits the racket, there is a significant vibration. The hard ball cannot withstand it, and even skilled players find it difficult to control.
The logic and underlying implications of their existence are - tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it, and they also know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones, so they sell you cheap ones to deceive you. They know that after you play with it twice, you won't play again, so this racket is cheap, and you won't feel sorry for it either.
When you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it shows that you have made progress. At that time, come to me and buy expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, better quality racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not very well-known, so good rackets don't sell for high prices. It's good enough to have a new racket for 500 or 600 yuan. Second-hand ones are 200 yuan. Isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a racket worth thousands of yuan?
Friendly for beginners, but becomes a disappointment after the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Can you please help follow up on this?
Postpone/delay
Thank you
That is to say, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Do I no longer need to pay attention to that previous order?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but the food that was delivered was missing a lot, and the saliva chicken was also raw.
#PRS_ORG# I'm told out of the blue that I have to pick it up myself. Please cancel it, if possible.
The order I placed is for delivery, there is no option for self-pickup.

In fact, there are many considerations for dressing and matching for girls with a slightly plump body.
The dress that a chubby girl wears should not be too short or too long. The length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the chubby part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on your legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear different colors for the upper body, dress, and long stockings, it will make you naturally appear taller, creating a slimming effect.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for plump girls (the author deeply understands this point), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body's plumpness, and a classy and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice for plump girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, will make people think you look thinner.
If your calves are chubby, don't wear socks and shoes that attract too much attention.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people noticing your legs and feet and feeling overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tips for dressing well.
Plump girls should avoid wearing tight short skirts. Also, the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, you should wear black high stockings or fishnet stockings (the ones with fine grids). Choose a soft printed flared skirt and pair it with a loose-necked top, which can effectively cover up the shortcomings of plump girls.
Of course, there are also considerations for slightly plump girls when wearing short skirts.
A chubby girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make your plump figure appear taller.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs appear longer and more slender. This is the trendiest outfit for summer!
If you have a chubby upper body but slim legs, it is recommended to choose a glamorous and stylish short dress.
Not only can it cover the belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
A-line skirts can make you look slim, which is more suitable for chubby girls. The top should be more fitted to create a layered look that will make you appear slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt with a skirt, even chubby girls can give it a try.
Curvy girls can also dress stylishly.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and collocation well, plump girls will also become the focus of attention.
After making changes in the aspect of clothing matching, it is also necessary to exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of being slightly chubby as soon as possible. 😄

Girl becomes human target to raise funds for older sister: "As long as it's just superficial injuries, it's alright." - Xinhua News
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Wulin Square, Hangzhou, with the words "Human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willingly becomes a 'target' for her sister's fundraising" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly taller than a person. The board has the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan Per Arrow" written on it, indicating that passersby can pay and use a bow and arrow to shoot.
This behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the propaganda officer of the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to a journalist from the Beijing News that the police have confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move in order to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being admonished, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl warned for street "bullseye" fundraising
In the circulating picture, a long-haired girl stands in the shape of the Chinese character "个" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with black ink saying "Human flesh target, ten yuan per arrow". In front of her, another wooden board is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The picture sparked controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this act is a "begging behavior for attention", while many others sympathize with it.
"We discovered the situation around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the plaza. There were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
According to the police officers from the Tianshui Police Station near the scene, who were interviewed by local media, there were two girls selling their products at the stall. Both of them were around 20 years old and dressed beautifully and youthfully.
Among them, the girl who was being targeted by people was crying while begging passersby to play this game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, please help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl is fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Xicheng Sub-Bureau of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from New Beijing News that the girl's name is Jijiali, and she is raising funds for her sister Jijia Yan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses, they couldn't come up with a good way to raise funds for a while, so they resorted to this action.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls acted as a target, and the other was responsible for assisting, but did not participate. No one was found to have shot arrows throughout the entire process, only some people watched and took photos, which were then posted on Weibo.
After the police handled the case, the relevant security department concluded that the bow and arrow used does not fall within the controlled category.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate adopting this attention-seeking fundraising method."
After being warned by the police station, she has already left the police station.
Heat dissipation effect: good Thinness: convenient Appearance material: satisfied Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, no problem with the four air outlets for heat dissipation, worthy of recommendation.
This Acer Predator Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with good workmanship and materials. Trustworthy brand!
Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not expensive in terms of price.
Personally, I think the Acer Predator Helios is really good. Game performance: The game performance is smooth, and you can play most games. My framerate when playing PUBG is stable and very smooth. League of Legends goes without saying, and CS:GO is also easily handled. Most triple-A games can be played.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is good, the fan is powerful, it works quietly, and even with the game effects turned up, the fan is still not small.
Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool and eye-catching, just as a gaming laptop should be. Display effect: The screen is very clear, 1080 is enough for gaming.
Buying a notebook feels pretty good, it's really great. It's mainly used for design, and the cost performance is very high. It's lighter than imagined and looks better than imagined. The red on the back is a very beautiful wine color, not so gaudy. Overall, it exceeds expectations by a lot. It's worth buying, and it's also suitable for girls.
I started using the Acer Dark Knight two years ago and after using it for two years, the cost performance is relatively high and the quality is excellent!
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
Currently, these three models have been purchased in this series!
The appearance is beautiful and attractive, and the configuration is also very good.
Bought for my nephew, originally planned to wait for the bank promotion on April 18th, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance, so I missed the big bank promotion, a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics is also quite fast. Let's come back for a follow-up review after using it for a while.
Brand new original, high cost-effective gaming notebook computer, design style is very good, already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for children to use for 3D rendering, software has been installed, child says it can be used without any problems, this computer can perform for 3D design work.
Bought for my son, he says it's very good.
The computer is great, especially the customer service attitude is very good. If you don't understand anything, just ask, I recommend purchasing.
Not bad, the graphics of the game are really good.
What is the most popular thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes?
A while ago, there was an article "Look! Project Managers Can Aim for Olympic Gold Medals" which gained a lot of popularity. It mentioned that project managers are absolutely leading the way in many projects, unmatched by anyone else: bricklaying, business trips, and staying up late are the daily routine for project managers, while firefighting, taking the blame, and apologizing are simply a given.
A seemingly joking and teasing article, but it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing a sense of powerlessness in current project management work.
