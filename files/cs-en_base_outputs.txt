The great return of the Czech jinx is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL.
Czech ice hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning back to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the bench and could soon also get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russian Čeljabinsk got injured during the preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
Exactly in the middle of the game against Vegas, he was substituted and since then he has not appeared on NHL ice.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one post to the other.
"Pavel Francouz will be out for approximately three to four weeks with a lower body injury," announced the Denver team at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning American time, he was called from the farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In AHL, he recorded 94.5% of saves.
The product of Plzen hockey wants to finally make a breakthrough and prove that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In the last season, he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic season, he did not play a single game.
In the NHL, "Francík" played 36 games, his save percentage is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a mask in his Christmas greeting, William and Kate pose in Jordan.
British Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photograph taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas greeting.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photograph in which he helps his wife Camilla put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported it on their website.
Wishes are sent to friends, colleagues, and foundations they collaborate with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a polo shirt, just like Prince George and Prince Louis.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not disclose, it is also not clear exactly when it was taken.
Yesterday, the royal family posed for a photograph intended as a Christmas greeting on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk County.
The photo, which will serve as a Christmas greeting, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured in June at Ascot races.
Charles, who has a top hat on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which is color-coordinated with her light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbr a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Detectives allegedly worked on the current corruption case with the assumption that the accused former vice-president of the Czech Football Association, Roman Berbr, was promised one million Czech crowns by Prague Slavia for winning the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server reported that it had gained access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the red and white team did not engage in any corrupt behavior.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who left the championship club last summer, is mainly mentioned.
According to the document, the former influential official of the red and white team was in frequent contact with both Berber and former sports director of the then second league team Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The detectives allegedly worked with the information that Slavia Berbrová promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authority had information that Roman (Berbr) was promised a million-dollar bribe by officials of SK Slavia Prague for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the detectives, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the Slavia board, Tvrdík.
According to the file, it is not clear whether the police are still dealing with this information, according to the server.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt behavior.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal activities, sought to influence referees in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided any financial payments to anyone in this regard," Tvrdík said for Seznam Zprávy.
In the locker room, among other things, Nezmar rudely insults some former dark-skinned Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing through referees was triggered by a police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the Czech Football Association, in the middle of October last year.
The highest-ranking person in the affair is Berbr, who no longer holds any football positions.
In mid-January, he was released from custody, just like former sports director Rogoz of Vyšehrad.
Helicopters, tanks, and IFVs are larping the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but fundamentally of a worse type (artillerymen will have to load the ammunition manually from an armored cabin without any cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good.
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, it has already been possible to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have any (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - Cold War era, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
There is a hunting lodge right next to the city.
Nutrias were crawling out of the river and causing damage to crops, so I went there to sit down.
When I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I thought he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox went in a while.
I let her come within 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the chair, he was gone.
That is, the meadow can be a disaster.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of many coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be visible in thermal imaging, which almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, put expensive things at your feet in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
Internally, respirators were obtained significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
Czech source:The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day, the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities acted economically?
And why did others shop more expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with iRozhlas editor Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate soldiers and the army (perhaps I am not affected by memories of the Czechoslovak People's Army, which older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from compulsory military service.
We don't even have large warehouses of equipment that trained people could handle, we don't actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover modern equipment is constantly becoming more complex, so the abilities of the reservists will rapidly deteriorate over time.
In addition to modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can be deployed, they will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense have great importance for countries like Ukraine, where it is possible to conduct mass guerrilla warfare and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
The fight in the Czech Republic will only succeed in a conflict of such scale and intensity where guerrilla warfare will be irrelevant, and we do not have suitable geography for it.
We mainly don't have individual skill.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then such a situation arises, that you look like a cool guy, who missed an empty goal 2 minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss guys and you say to yourself "damn, what do you think will happen now?".
Of course, they will choose him as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to beat a defender" is so terrible that I caught myself honestly surprised when I see that our forward managed to outplay one opponent player.
First swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, however experts do not expect any significant turnaround in the coming weeks.
The pressure in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown variable has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know, the Omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta variant.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, to what extent vaccination helps against it, or the post-infection immunity acquired from previous illness.
But this week an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the Covid equations: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be used for at-home treatment.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent from previous results.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up on the tape first also because the drug started to be developed long before the current pandemic broke out in order to find a suitable treatment for viral diseases in horses on the South American continent.
In these studies, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and openly do not share their opinions.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "as our beak grew."
You will conduct a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you without hesitation that no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist scum.
And then they go and vote for parties like AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their job and facing media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west good, the east bad.
But it will really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to unit rotation, so that soldiers do not have to learn where everything is again, all objects are exactly the same.
From one is the Atom Museum Brdy and the remaining two are abandoned.
It's funny that the USSR didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple tree), only the warheads were stored, not the entire rockets as it is said.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Apart from that museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate who was a Roma, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often expressed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone dealt with him, he often walked and wanted to explain something, he was almost missing, he walked regularly, he engaged in sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he walked in clean clothes.
He also went on school trips, did various monkey business, but he was cool, maybe never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, Roma, entered the same year, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and endangered other students.
Personally, I occasionally sell something through advertisements (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I have often sold to Roma people, they always had the money, they didn't try to trick me into lowering the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called after a month saying that he had already transferred it to his name.
I myself say that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other color, as long as they behave as they should in decent society (work, function, don't beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, extends their hand, occupies apartments and houses, has only disorder around them, causes problems... then it doesn't matter what color they are, but it will bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, as long as they integrate, start businesses, work, learn the language (not necessarily Czech, at least English), and respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs too.
A young woman died in a car accident in the Prachatice region.
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot, despite resuscitation care," said Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for the South Bohemian paramedics, to Právo.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was carrying the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving from the village of Žíchovec towards the village of Bavorov and for reasons yet unknown, he veered into the opposite lane in a curve.
After colliding with a Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof off the road, described the accident spokesperson of the South Bohemian police, Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and he remained trapped in the car.
After being rescued, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and, in a stable condition, he was transported by air to the hospital in České Budějovice, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered minor chest injuries and was transported to the hospital.
For packages from countries outside the EU, new rules apply, customers often do not provide the necessary information.
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where postage is often free," explains the collector.
Since October, ordering small shipments has become slightly more expensive for him, he now has to add VAT and provide the post office with information for customs clearance.
He receives an email with a message that customs officials are expecting the arrival of a package.
Just fill in the shipment details, and if the VAT was not included by the merchant at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and transportation.
In case the recipient does not arrange the customs procedure themselves, the carrier's fee must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
Click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are successfully delivered smoothly.
Due to new customs rules, the daily number of incoming international shipments in Prague has decreased from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, there is also a problem that people do not respond to requests for providing information that is necessary for completing the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the necessary information and did so on time, we would be about halfway there, says Matyáš Vitík, spokesperson for Czech Post.
Solution to inflation
As the title suggests, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
Currently, we are at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What should the state do, in your opinion, to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and basic necessities in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable about where it is heading?
Prices are rising faster than wages, it is inevitable in my opinion that people will not be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get added, for example (who is the employee)?
They added 2% to my gross income this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from my business that I operate while employed.
Could someone explain to me why proven violent offenders are sent behind bars for only 6 months, for example?
This just doesn't make sense to me, how can a court send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months just for them to do it again as soon as they get out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
And not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it either.
Wouldn't this also discourage potential future reporting of rape victims?
The man from Hrob "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat.
The man from Hrob unintentionally helped the guards to apprehend his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He called her himself.
He went about it in a roundabout way.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were astonished when the alleged "robbed" person told them that he had made it all up so that the guards would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to ask the guards for advice on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
During the identity check of the man and his girlfriend, the guards found out that the woman is on the list of wanted persons in a nationwide search, and there is an arrest warrant issued for her.
The case is being handled by the Czech Police.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that we Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally the same, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I obviously agree with the meme, it's a shame that Churchill didn't manage to secure the liberation of Prague by the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can truly believe in something without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I cannot agree with Pascal here, there are approximately, if I'm not mistaken, around ten thousand different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you if you believe in a different god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it states that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god, rather than risking that out of those thousands of gods, I choose wrongly and the one true god, whom I happen to miss, sends me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserve.
The Swiss model is similar, I guess.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months on one) under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a person behaves well, they can get a professional offer.
All units of the Czech Armed Forces would find something like this useful.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being discussed, companies are fishing in schools, and there is some kind of intermingling, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, transitioning from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I perceive it as a way to build a certain relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, the institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or even Mongolian invaders will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies and they will therefore defend us if there is trouble.
Do not please the Lord.
Just one election in the USA that will screw up their budget and the whole NATO goes to hell.
The English translation is:The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just need to turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that consistently functions as a guarantee of independence is a heavily armed army and a population that knows how to operate military technology of its time.
And today every teenager can pilot remote-controlled devices, so why wouldn't it be possible.
We don't need border fortifications, that's useless today, but a skilled teenager with a remote-controlled device will manage.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home overwhelmed by boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of stores that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not just during Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
That is why it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains nearly 150 of them) by agreement.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as saved money, as the price of packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One of such stores is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco-friendly detergents and eco-friendly cosmetics.
Individuals and companies bring us boxes and packing material to Popůvky near Brno, which accumulates at their homes. However, we also receive calls from companies with whom we have arranged regular pickups of discarded cardboard.
We will use everything when packaging shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more considerate world together.
"Our wish is to preserve the resources and natural beauty for future generations," says Petra Lopušníková from Tierry.
The application www.KAMsNIM.cz, however, shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to dispose of expired medications, tires, used electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
The total project map now contains over 100,000 such places.
"Gradually, collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs, and other places are being added to it, which help find a use for things that would otherwise become waste," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the organization Ukliďme Česko.
I find it rather bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone to play games do not learn basic computer skills while doing so.
Recently, a problem has emerged (especially in English articles) that college students do not understand the concept of computer components.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything onto one screen in the app.
Let them use technology from childhood, but above all, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French presidency of the EU before the weekend - starting in January - and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that cannot be accomplished in half a year.
French politicians like it and so do the voters.
Supporters of Macron's bridging between the right and the left agree on little, but precisely on Europe.
And in France there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
French leader mentioned among other things that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is engaged in pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is rather an attempt to rewrite history.
Extreme right-wing candidate for French president Éric Zemmour is currently touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French people.
Let's take Macron's idea for a history textbook seriously and not pay attention to what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
Spaniards, French, Czechs are finding out who defeated whom in which battle.
However, if they do not have an enlightened teacher, they will not learn about the broader context of the event.
The film of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for directing and for best actress Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he ranked high on the audience ranking.
In Berlin, Anthony Hopkins became the best actor for the film The Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like having the flu/being stuffed. I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
It was worse than the common flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone feels the same way)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on December 20th, will contain a traditional literary supplement.
And along with her, cultural tips will also be published.

Trains start running according to the new timetable, some transporters will change.
Trains will start running according to the new timetable from Sunday.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts operating instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, possibly also their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Ticket sales started by carriers already during the autumn.
Czech Railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger connections daily in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be operated in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase ticket prices from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace Czech Railways here after success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the track daily, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at the stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou, and Kolín from Sunday.
Leo Express has kept its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia, and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesperson Emil Sedlářík, the carrier tried to maintain as similar as possible travel times for its long-distance trains, despite planned track maintenance work.
The operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also be replaced on some regional routes.
Changes are awaiting passengers, for example in Českolipsko, where trains of the German company Die Länderbahn, operating under the name Trilex, will be running instead of Czech Railways on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk.
Passengers will be able to use unified railway tickets for the second year as well.
Just like with Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn to see the other side easily?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work hard, they died.
In my life, I have never heard teaching from the perspective of the slave-owning side or from that time, nobody defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people often sold themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slave owners.
No one will teach you at school that colonizers often bought land from Indians, they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans exterminated them, even though they had been killing each other long before.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly at schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally concealing facts, but I have heard before that it happens and in my opinion, it is a problem, I do not deny that (for example, war crimes from WW2 are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History does not care about someone's feelings, it is simply what it is and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without considering the perspective from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, while we're on the subject of those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slave owners are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some of their own successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better than many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South were slave owners and they were also opposed to many things.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit certain facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, for example, our perspective does not exist for them (there was even a video on YouTube where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found funny about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized and the schools often supported them in that.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older someday, it makes me feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and also in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has already achieved what it was supposed to and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore basic biological facts are being referred to as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, often resulting in resistance even to fairly reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also haven't encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I rather met with bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't achieve on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality overall to be unnecessary in terms of personal identity.
If something connects me with people, it's interests, perspectives on the world, and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
This Slovak priest is a really nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always messes up with some bullshit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then there is, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they attend services at the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist church on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominikánské Square belongs to the Dominicans and they even hold a Latin mass there every Sunday at 15:00, as it was done before Vatican II.
The Bethlehem Flame is in the Czech Republic, scouts have taken it from Austria.
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not travel to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic, but this time they also did not go to Vienna, in the morning they picked him up from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing.
They were taking her at the border last year too.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with our group every year, I'm really looking forward to it.
"It is an honor for me that I have been chosen," said scout Amálie Budíková to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now it is taking place at the Reintal - Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts travel by train to Vienna for him.
There are no changes in the distribution of the flame throughout the Czech Republic.
The scouts set off with the Bethlehem light traditionally by train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of light on Saturday, December 18th, traveling on selected express trains as well as passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, and then they will continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic, even to places where railways do not lead.
This year, scouts must adhere to the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It is happening similarly to last year.
We provide recommendations to both courier teams and organizers of local events to wear masks, try to maintain distance, have as few people as possible, not sing together, and behave in a way that is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship, and harmony along with the flame.
The Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts have been taking care of its spread for over 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human solidarity.

I do not have an economic education, so I do not know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I do not think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare, and education will make proper use of the money, I just don't understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry, and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is being produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where there are millions of signs in the corridors saying "xy financed/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not support from a company that provides jobs for x people, this is hindering development when this company is barely holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Complete agreement, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also falls into some trick or trap - especially advertisements.
I personally think that internet ads don't affect me, but then I still catch myself being influenced by them - it's just so sophisticated that one can't always resist it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, who currently want to impose a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all rubbish, in the words of a classic - I would ban the internet.
I have a feeling that this belief has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
"I will not believe in something that the majority believes and makes sense, I am not a sheep after all, but I would rather believe in something that is less likely, doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion which I will claim is critical thinking."
2. "I won't believe everything the media says."

Television has fallen behind the trend of Christmas movies, this year they have two hundred premieres.
Los Angeles - China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have embraced the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will premiere a record-breaking number of over two hundred to their viewers.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
Genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been gaining popularity among the audience in recent years and significantly increasing viewership, which is why more and more of these movies are being made.
This year, four times more Christmas movies were made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database, however, included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is particularly associated with fairy tales, globally popular films such as Home Alone, Heavenly Love, or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas movies, however, started in 2009 when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series, as reminded by the BBC server.
Her Advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four movies and was very successful.
This station started tuning its viewers for Christmas as early as October 22nd this year and will present a total of 42 Christmas movies.
The competitive station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the overall total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't really matter that much, what's important is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," exaggeratedly described Brandon Gray, the author of the book about Christmas movies titled I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For viewers, it is a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace amidst all the holiday madness and the madness of the world we have been living in for the past few years," Gray added.
According to him, for example, the Hallmark television uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there is some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which is successfully resolved and the two of them kiss.
This is how it goes on and on, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch them one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will start in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for Covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
Haas team will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to aim for a better position than the 20th place he achieved in qualifying.
Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not ultimately participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for Covid-19.
On the starting grid, only nineteen cars will appear, Mick Schumacher, Mazepin's teammate, will start from the last position, and Max Verstappen, who will directly compete with Lewis Hamilton for the title, will start from the first position.
According to Haas team's statement, Mazepin is relatively fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
Now she is in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all parties involved," her representatives stated for formula1.com.
Haas will not send a substitute driver to the race, nor can they.
The potential substitute would have to complete a qualification or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with Covid-19.
At the start of the just-ended season, Kimi Räikkönen had Covid-19, while Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can also be imprisoned for this.
And everyone will not care that the boss said.
From a legal perspective, Covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice, or typhoid.

(3) The offender shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a period of three to ten years if he causes serious bodily harm to at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) The offender shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for five to twelve years if the act specified in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver, and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It's a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never really worn at home," admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours working on his piece over the course of six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France, and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarovski.
He adorned the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater," praises the creator his work, which, however, he does not recommend washing.
And there is one more catch.
"I'm completely broke, I need to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," admits Liban.
If successful, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

About the situation in the USA with a prominent African American reporter.
New cases of police violence are coming to light in the United States, this time during interventions at nationwide protests.
The demonstrations that erupted after African American George Floyd was killed by a police officer during an arrest opened up a debate about systemic racism, police work, and cases of brutality against American minorities.

The Union brings us money in subsidies.
If it stops doing that, we will stop having that money.
I really don't see how the fact that the union will stop giving us money would cause us to use that money for something else...
You can argue that the money from those subsidies could be used better, but that is a completely different discussion.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to assist Poland.
Engineers, explorers, and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime, which has been inviting citizens from Middle Eastern countries to its territory with false promises of easy crossing of the EU border for several months.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron variant spreading in southern Moravia?
Hygiene checks another case of a child from Adamov.
"We have currently received another report of suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class."
"Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," said Ciupek.
Six cases appeared in the region during the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is being conducted by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that it concerns two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students from the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have an asymptomatic course.
No one suspected of Omicron traveled abroad.
None of the mentioned people traveled abroad, nor did anyone from their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who was staying abroad.
There is no connection to the water polo championship for any of the mentioned individuals, said Ciupek.
Chief Hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that an international water polo tournament, which took place in Brno a few weeks ago, is being investigated.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player who fell ill upon returning.
California will restrict the sale of firearms.
He wants to proceed like Texas in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to introduce a ban on the sale and production of certain firearms in the most populous American state, using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial law against abortions performed after the detection of the embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement responded to Friday's statement by the US Supreme Court, which upheld the Texas abortion ban, despite it contradicting a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion nationwide up to approximately the 24th month of pregnancy.
The court, however, did not decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on a technical question arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was, in fact, transferred to the public in this case, which prevented its usual legal challenge by the Texan Republicans.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," said the governor of California.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He allegedly instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost guns.
These are commonly referred to as homemade weapons, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over 220,000 CZK) and legal expenses from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, ghost gun components, or kits for their production in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that is exactly what we should do," said the California governor.
The AP agency emphasizes that California has banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the local ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually reinstate the ban using the Texas template, the words of liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed. In her dissenting opinion to Friday's majority verdict, she warned against the expansion of this legal mechanism to other American states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant complete immunity to the Texas abortion ban from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue with lawsuits against selected officials in the southern United States.
Every emergency vaccination has its public testing phase, during which the vaccination schedule is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, studies on the effects of 4 doses are already rolling in from Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is an up to fivefold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Simply like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should soon come to the market, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times greater effectiveness.
Leave the amount of material calmly.
But reconsider WHAT is being taught.

How can I legally watch the Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
At home, we have Netbox and I pay for the Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League, but I don't want to change my TV and internet provider.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget.
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act unlawfully if it used new powers and stopped the payment of funds to Poland due to the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the use of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use the mechanism allowing for the withdrawal of EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU by vetoing all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Polsko should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, added the Polish minister.
His party takes more radical positions on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system underwent during Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Ziobro, is imposing "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such EU that is based on partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party will never agree to such concessions from Brussels that would result in Poland's sovereignty being limited.
"We will never agree for Poland to have the status of a colony," he declared.
But to understand it... At Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I also encountered one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, Parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and lactose-free zone...
If I avoid it, I won't even go to any market, action or non-action, the golden shop on the square, they may not have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I would take a vacation to Lidl.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I have been observing how data is being handled here like manure, the majority of vaccine opponents are just slightly more off track than the majority of vaccine supporters.
Rational discussion is taking place at a professional level, but only extreme opinions are reaching the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it like this and we have it like this.
But nobody is addressing the fact that the data collection methodology is different in those two states.
Phew, I feel relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and I wish you all a nice day.
They punished me with a spoon in my childhood.
It was never about the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehaved (reading instead of going to sleep, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I have never been punished without warning, my mom always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get a hit (sometimes even after catching me again, she would just bring a spoon and place it so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I receive a few spanks on the buttocks (over clothing).
Personally, I believe that physical punishments (in a reasonable manner and extent) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than to words.
According to me, the important part is the warning, because it gives the child in a way the choice whether to disobey and get punished, or to improve and avoid punishment.
In the end, I usually only needed a warning to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist's question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document sworn upon and taught in schools from an early age, or rather an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first interpretation.
Once we agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save with changes.
And imagine this: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as Czechs love dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed over the question at that time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is increasingly being expressed among lawyers.
It is tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not predict, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
In one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The institution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing the majority of crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that set the boundaries of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we restrict politicians with prohibitions.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in the Brno University Hospital they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby.
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with, especially recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, with estimates ranging from 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, to Novinky.
The course is usually much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
However, there are pediatric patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in recent times," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at the clinic for pediatric infectious diseases.
Seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been in the ICU.
Children with post-COVID syndromes were continuously on the ward throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, which means inflammation of the lungs that requires a stay in the intensive care unit," he said, adding that this disease affects not only adults but also adolescents and even infants as young as a few months old.
In hospitals, there are also children in critical condition due to the coronavirus.
"At present, we have a child of several months and adolescent age lying with us," said the head physician.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths from coronavirus have been recorded at the Children's Hospital of the University Hospital Brno so far.
According to available data, there were six deaths of children aged 0 to 14 in the Czech Republic by December 6th.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in the children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination in children mitigates the course of the disease and simultaneously reduces the occurrence of post-COVID syndrome.
"That is why we recommend the vaccination doses for children as well," added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on designated paths.
But the quiet zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the game reserve).
Skiing/cycling in the forest off the marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have a permit (but of course, it is not really monitored that much outside of national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
The music is playing in my head, Josef Kurfiřt is laughing.
He is connected to the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can practically sing any repertoire and as a conductor, he works not only at the F. Šaldy Theater in Liberec but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He collaborates with the Hradec Králové Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic, or the Sub-Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is creating the impression of having managed the infection and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression of having mastered the infection and that the authoritarian regime is handling the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing faced criticism for failing to contain the infection, which turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected cases.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, including the hardest-hit Italy.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is it about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, do you want an elephant?
I have it and it's great.
The wife is happy because she mows the grass, washes the car with a hose, and the children play with it.
Just great.
If you want, I will sell you the little elephant for 5000 CZK.
Friend: Alright, let's give each other a high five, it will be great...
After some time, they meet and the one who bought it complains: you idiot, what did you sell me for an elephant???
The lawn is trampled, giant piles of dung everywhere, the car is broken, the children are scared of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold it says: you speak badly about the little elephant, you won't sell the elephant like this...
World affairs are dominated by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a superpower only if it works on its integration.
This currently works at the level of economic and political (in selected issues), but military integration is still missing.
Personally, I believe that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will succeed.
It also occurred to me and it is quite possible.
I am not an expert in Czech, so I may be nitpicking.
I only assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that both are from Spain, whereas with "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that the mandarins are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the sentence says "all American forces," including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad concept and there is no need to further specify it for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just nitpicking :D
Whether it is so or not, it is an absurd request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey named Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
The monkey in Holland was also fed hot dogs, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Magistrates' Court in Gwent has now permanently banned her from keeping animals, The Sun newspaper reported.
Rehabilitation experts for monkeys, who are taking care of Milly after her abuse, have stated that they have never seen a scared chimpanzee like her before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with the workers of Monkey World in Dorset and now she is happily playing again with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A quadruple mother admitted to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to twelve weeks of imprisonment with a suspended sentence for one year at the Magistrates' Court in Gwent.
Hollandova was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a lifelong ban on animal breeding, and must pay court costs of 12,000 Czech crowns.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue further."
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
And now, when she has settled down and is content with the male, the sight of new people can still trigger panic in her.
Psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, adds Sawyer.
The abuse of Milly came to light after the police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage on her phone during a raid on her apartment for drug charges.
In the shots, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In the next video, you can hear Hollandova offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
Lick my fingers.
In May, she, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found weighing 1600 pounds (equivalent to just under 50 thousand Czech crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Hollandova received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric era three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
How come you take the same things in first grade as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of cramming, when no one, with few exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
Mainly write the test for a 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Go out and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients.
Everyone went through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even flinch and they will tell you that they don't give a damn.
So what the fuck is he learning for?
I am a big fan of general overview and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that moment, it is unnecessary and you will never get it into them anyway.
It is partially learned for the many people who will need that particular thing here.
But seriously, I meant that you really don't need all this for standing at the machine... ...because you simply don't need it.
Moreover, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also contributed to by our communist past and incitement against intellectuals and elites) However, the price of having barbarians operating those machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists could count, then Covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: The war between Kadri and Andrea continues!
"That is the main reason why Switzerland cannot leave right away," Andrea replied on Instagram Stories to curious fans' nosy questions about what disappointed her about Kadrim so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social media.
There was tension between Kadri and Andre during the experiment from the very beginning.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move with him, at least until he permanently returned to the Czech Republic.
She resolutely refused it.
And as you can see, their relationship not only didn't end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! Kadri exclaimed in response to Andreina's accusations of lies, gambling, and debts.
The alleged honesty of Kadri now no longer pleased his ex-wife or his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on these things at all, and even in the family, we never really talked about these things much.
I definitely don't want to evoke any pity.
But when I see someone trying to harm and tarnish the name of someone I love so much, I just can't stand it!
I'm sorry that I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, despite his young age.
It bothers me even more when I have to read such untrue information that is probably taken out of context.
I would really like everyone, our loved ones and family, to know Kadri as I do, it stands in response to Andrey's words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the truth and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Czech source:Cchao began his robbery expedition in the parking lot of a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he didn't come up with anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and sneak into the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
In the footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene and eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he realized that the bananas were not where they were supposed to be and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cchaa.
The man admitted that he had consumed some alcohol on the incriminated day.
And given that he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic state of emergency.
When it is canceled, the law will not be effective.
The law restricts the scope of business.
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of voters turned out for Saturday's elections to the municipal councils of four municipalities.
New councils were elected by people on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councilors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disintegrated here.
Out of a total of 28 mandates, 99 candidates competed on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and particularly closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Deputy Chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office Eva Krumpová.
She reminded that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in Uherské Hradiště, the Independent Candidates Association won the Saturday elections, gaining 27.76 percent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means gaining two mandates.
Two seats in the council were also won by Citizens for Komňa, they were given their vote by 18.52 percent of voters.
The current mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromníků, has once again been elected to the council.
The Komňané - independent candidates have achieved one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou emerged victorious.
It received 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four mandates out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one representative from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have been elected to the municipal council.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lužice and Svinčice Association, led by Mayor Jindřich John, won the repeated elections in Lužice in the Mostecko region.
It received 56.73 percent of the votes and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The second place was taken by the candidate list "Obec pro lid", which received 43.27 percent of the votes, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The independent candidates "Hope for Nová Ves" won the elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region ahead of the ANO Movement.
For the association of independent candidates, 59.88 percent of voters voted, thus gaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the votes and strengthened its position against the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and now has three.
The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the elections will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this that people are writing to you here well.
You're just pretending to be a fool so you have someone to argue with.
If not, then it's sad.
I do not claim that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
Even a lot of church buildings appeal to me aesthetically (which, after all, was the goal, for them to look good).
And I really don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, for example the Thirty Years' War.
TL;DR: Believe in the spaghetti monster if you want, but the state and the church have nothing to do with each other.
The man fell headfirst from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava on Sunday night, who was attended to by the regional Emergency Medical Services.
Workers at the regional operational center received an emergency call with initial information about a man falling from a height an hour after midnight on Saturday.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - were dispatched to the scene immediately.
Upon arrival at the scene, the medical personnel determined that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from a window from a height of approximately twelve meters and landed on his head on concrete!
In Vítkovice, they caught coal.
But not as it should be, and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate life-threatening danger.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation, and after further measures within pre-hospital urgent care, he was transported by an ambulance to the further care of the Ostrava Traumatology Center, informed the spokesperson of the Emergency Medical Services of the Moravian-Silesian Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more concerned about inadequate reactions from the public and authorities than about the coronavirus.
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic poses a challenge for politicians and officials, but it is primarily doctors and healthcare personnel who are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We are asking military doctor David Řezáč.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt.
MMA experienced a fantastic gala evening full of interesting results.
At the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Czech source:Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who had not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira in the lightweight division did not hesitate, he showed great choking against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also recorded a victory, quickly sweeping Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
It brought a women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as a figurative "dwarf", as Nunes had not lost for seven years and was sharpening her teeth for another triumph.
The beginning of the duel also followed the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesova started her journey for victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not let herself be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack using a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated themselves to plenty of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
Peňová additionally got Nunesova to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up the effort and tap out.
The American woman shocked everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the main event was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier was doing better, but the tide gradually began to turn.
In the second round, Oliveira tried to be more active and attempted to defeat his opponent with an armbar.
Although he didn't succeed too much, he then created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back, and showered him with a series of punches.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira demonstrated a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but eventually had to tap out.
The Brazilian defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley recorded a dominant victory, as he landed a hard right rear on Raulian Paiva already in the first round.
Subsequently, he finished him off with a series of accurately aimed strikes and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to handle Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she lost.
This hip, or that hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so there is no problem determining whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter.
Then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When declining, they take two different endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words "svízel" and "kyčel" are of both masculine and feminine gender, in the former they are declined according to the pattern of "stroj", in the latter according to the pattern of "píseň".
In the next group of nouns, there are different forms already in the nominative singular, for example: "řádek/řádka" (line), "kedluben/kedlubna" (cabbage), or "brambor/brambora" (potato).
Both forms are standard, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "okurka" in Bohemia and "okurek" in Moravia, in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly other Czech-Moravian pairs of words are: "příkop" and "příkopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally indeclinable, but gradually adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the word "image", which is of both masculine and feminine gender, or the word "bufet", which remains in the neuter gender uninflected, but in the masculine it has endings according to the pattern of "hrad" (castle).
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation like directly on the Greek borders?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the increasing number of migrants trying to move further into Europe.
Thousands of people started heading towards the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to take an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
"We haven't seen blue sky for three months and we were suffocating," describes a journalist from Sydney.
Destructive fires, which Australia has been struggling with for the fourth month, have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the local authorities and the residents themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government do more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone always writes about everything everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to cover it up.
I personally do not know anyone who has been falsely accused.
I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have witnessed how their surroundings or even the police often treat these people.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
However, too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and a slap in the face to all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large portion of accusations are fabricated" and that it is a "trend," you are only helping sexual offenders.
Czech source:Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families don't have money to finish them.
Prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people have found themselves in a difficult situation because of it.
She does not have the means to complete the unfinished family houses and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the cost of construction work is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete already under construction family houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgage loans for them, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people are moving into unfinished and uncertified houses.
"In the worst case, the unfinished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to repay their mortgages and also pay rent," says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two to three family houses in a year and it has happened to us in fifty percent of cases.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult because we have to adhere to certain contractual obligations, even though the material has become more expensive.
"So we are operating without profit," said Zdeněk Slivoň, owner of a construction company.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
"I think some will wait," added Slivoň.
Copper, iron, as well as plumbing and heating equipment have become the most expensive materials.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of graduates in construction fields and the influx of foreign workers is being hindered by the pandemic.
The situation regarding the issuance of building permits is currently more favorable.
"The building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is nearly 10 percent more than last year," clarified Křeček.
We are doing well and we will be even better.
Real visions are missing, says commentator ČRO - myRadio
Entry into the new year, in addition to the traditional celebrations, was traditionally accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and the Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What important did we learn?
As for me, the thesis seems great, I have my own topic that I chose, I am building on my bachelor's thesis, I always work on it for the whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
State exams are completely calm here, unless a person is a total idiot and something has remained in their head, the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate them with theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the exams and when I was struggling, the committee always tried to guide me towards some logical deduction, which I quickly grasped and got it right.
Otherwise, regarding those projects, I know people who pay someone to do their semester project for them (we did it many times, really beneficial, you learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
According to me, it's great when there is an exam at the end of the subject that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just a defense.
Everything is fine, but do not overload emails and phone calls and do not send any packages to the embassy.
You will be the same jerk as them.
These people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can also place a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even give it to him so that it touches Xi Jinping's butt or something like that.
I agree, even though Instagram throws sticks in the way of artists.
Once you don't post stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will decrease to an absolute minimum.
Moreover, it keeps changing what function is more important, whether it's a like, comment, or save.
I've been feeling really shitty lately, so I might have to resort to TikTok, where many artists in my industry are successful and they can't get enough of it.
In the end, I might even like it if something more user-friendly came along that doesn't drain artists of all their creativity and energy.
Statement of the Party of Workers in Donbas
Union - yes, breakup - no, opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal dissolution of the USSR.
On December 8th, 1991, the largest geopolitical catastrophe in the history of mankind occurred.
In the Białowieża Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum on March 17, 1991, with the open indulgence of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and disregarding the people, signed an agreement stating that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist."
With one stroke of the pen, they "abolished" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens ended up abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
And regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in both world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one sitting in the Białowieża Forest, destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, betrayed the socialist camp (created by the sacrifice of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
Consciously, they carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and detached fourteen republics from the largest world power, which were previously economically connected in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the military, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, the war and breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, first of the socialist camp, and then of the Soviet Union.
There is a term in political science called "power vacuum".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and conquered the NATO countries, which accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly because of the events from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high-turnover supermarket may not directly correspond to its quality and value.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I will buy it with the intention of putting it in the fridge and making dinner out of it on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, where I don't buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which this change in price becomes a burden for my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg, 1 day before the expiration date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more and kept it in my fridge for 3 days?
I will answer myself - with nothing.
These talks about how when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass, girls were handing out some brochure. I always take similar things to help the temporary workers, they can't throw it away...
No, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but there was nothing about God anywhere. I was confused, but I suspected that it would be some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who published it and in the end, Scientology came out of it.
No, he was a good sailor, full of completely unnecessary advice, like how I should wash myself and not be a jerk.
Paper shortage, because of this, forests wouldn't have to be cut down.
I have experienced something similar with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you love them without realizing how messed up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would harm herself because I went out to chat with a friend she didn't like.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and begged me on her knees not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
Approximately a year it was a great relationship but then another half a year passed and she started to go crazy.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her that we were breaking up and lied to her that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and prevent her from going crazy again.
Such a person sucks out your feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Better to keep distance
When insurance companies greedily buy up a cloud of tests and rush to find positives, who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease without the test.
The only thing we achieve is complications for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees have been randomly assigned five days of house arrest in the number generator.
In the West, they have already stopped with this nonsense and recognized that it is not worth dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and still needs to steal something and boost his ego by inventing nonsense.
I see that the old good junk is coming back to us again.
After several years of decline and suppression of this shady business, MLM recruiting is once again returning to the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested in that, just recruit people."
Honestly, I was interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, however, the trainings were more about scaring and persuading people.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if they want to earn, they have to sell several specific products monthly.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so a person felt like a door-to-door salesman of pots.
But what I can say is that it was a valuable experience, one learns not to jump at every rumor and thoroughly verify information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone into the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to others, but they certainly won't boast about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" bank account.
In the corporation where I work, I haven't experienced many things like that.
HR is calm, managers mind their own management and don't stick their noses into anything.
Regular evaluation is therefore happening somehow, in a form that is quite similar to how it is done here (set some goals for the next year, and after a year we will see what worked and what didn't) - it is more of a self-evaluation rather than someone evaluating you based on numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person has a feeling that we are like a quasi-startup squatting in the offices of a big corporation, you know.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as there are results.
The missing Czech in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, the British police searched in vain for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social media that a woman from Uherské Hradiště was found dead.
The British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they have unfortunately found the body of the missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide any further information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek stated on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on the bus on her way home from work, she was supposed to withdraw money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues at work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her as missing worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police detained one man several days ago in this context.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he is suspected of, but it has not been disclosed.
In four municipalities, new councils were elected by the end of the year.
On Saturday, December 11, new municipal councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in Uherské Hradiště, Lužice in Most, Nová Ves in Liberec, and Rovná in Pelhřimov.
The number of councilors in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disintegrated here.
Out of 28 mandates, 99 valid candidates ran in the new elections.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men obtained a mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
For the new elections to the municipal councils in the four mentioned municipalities, a total of 13 candidate lists were registered.
36 women and 63 men applied for the 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
We mostly had to work in more challenging epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, the 1st Vice President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12th at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease here, but it went without major obstacles.
To cope with how idiotically a large part of the population at all levels approaches it, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are assholes.
He would be deprived of the function of the president and the ability to regain it.
The chance that it will actually happen is very small, as others mention here.
Moreover, I'm not sure if classifying the file as treason could be considered at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who have been without sex for a whole year is increasing.
More and more young adults in the USA are living their lives without sex.
It mainly concerns religiously oriented people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who abstain from sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between 18 and 35 years old who reported not having had sexual intercourse in the past year are more than ever before.
The decrease in the number of sexually active individuals is also contributed by other factors, as shown by a survey conducted by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them can be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
The presence of media, social networks, and video games, which make sex a smaller and smaller priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been rapidly increasing," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Among married people, sexual activity is more frequent, with only 5% of them stating that they had been without sex in the last year in 2021.
Among free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The decrease in sexual activity is also contributed to by fear of premarital intercourse and religious beliefs.
Although there is a higher likelihood of married couples being sexually active, the percentage of married men and women under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people's opinion on premarital sex divides, about 30% consider it a bad thing, while approximately 70% think it is okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone speaks about these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious beliefs.
Since 2008, among unmarried people under the age of 35 who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to nearly 60%.
"Among the 'less believers', the trend has risen from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
The decrease in sexual activities is also contributed by other factors, such as less social interaction and especially the social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of having sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on mainly during the lockdown in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole vaccination mandate against Covid is about whether society should compel a portion of the population to engage in behavior they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, which personally interests me the most is the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we don't order them to do it and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could definitely be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old person who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he refused to get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we can be blamed for the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination who, alongside the SPD and the KSČ, shouts about harassment and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be fairly concluded that the majority of unvaccinated retirees probably belong to the second group, so they will really be responsible for it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year's winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Ski resort operators cannot do without artificial snow, weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerská padesátka cross-country skiing race.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a lack of snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have one story, but it's not about a religious person.
Once in high school, our teacher led us through the whole city to the boatyard so that we could take a ride on boats on the river.
On the way there, we were walking down a quite wide street and who do we see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
I fortunately escaped, but they started talking with one friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul."
I told them that I don't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We are terribly spoiled.
It doesn't happen that much, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter in our mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must jointly demonstrate that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border, should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group" consisting of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
Morawiecki stated that he informed the Chancellor about the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, as we witness a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border every night.
He discussed with the Chancellor about further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned Lukashenko's regime's inhumane treatment of refugees.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the accident scene after a while, but it was already being driven by a different nun who was trying to take the blame upon herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving way while driving and leaving the scene of the accident, she came clean, according to TVN24 station.
She admitted that she collided with another nun in the vehicle, who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breathalyzer test and after finding out that she had over two per mille of alcohol in her blood, they immediately confiscated her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would be confessing her actions in court.
The dog Hugo is doing his best.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not control his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have taken inspiration from American stories about beloved dogs.
But they forgot about one essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After the kitschy film F. Brabec's Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, another film Here We Guard is now vying for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-author of the screenplay and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Guard from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him are returning to the stage.
Julie and Ivan, owners of a pension in the Šumava region, which is struggling, so they start inviting dog owners to it, Julie's father with his partner, and especially their daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film's producer) struggled with storytelling techniques in their previous dog film, but at least children and the dog enjoyed it.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child and, when the right "constellation" occurs, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine - on the car hood or church tower (of course, during an ongoing excursion with a local guide). Retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma and is then taken to the hospital by the family, so that a miraculous healing process with a dog can take place in the heart of the Šumava wilderness.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
The audience is amazed at the jumble of content full of unbelievable situations and characters that was necessary for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a dog competition, a charlatan from the Šumava region, police officers arriving to investigate a "drug" report, and a discussion about the fertilizing power of bone meal herbs - all of which the intoxicated family in the guesthouse naturally drinks up.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and immediately sits at the family table with her hair curled and makeup on, smoking a cigarette, and demands her father's whiskey and steaks as a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
Above all, the creators will explain to the viewer that "this sometimes happens after a coma."
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build strong situations, a sense for character development and the punchline, and directorial guidance.
The acting performances are uneven, the editing is confused, and the overall impression is messy.
No matter how hard Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties together, they don't have much to play.
The only positive aspect of the film remains the poetic shots of the Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a weak plot, and dog phrases, let alone more vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even the long-standing membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between humans and dogs, knowledge of the craft is also necessary if one wants to tell a believable story.
It failed in this case.
There is a bit too much eroticism and a minimum of sentiment for the genre in this good family film.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing from idiots like you.
There is a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you don't understand shit about it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if they don't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to such kids all the time, you might change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only season of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have observed at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average precipitation for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
For us, it is good.
It hasn't rained for a long time.
"It is also the right Christmas setting," rejoiced the resident of Nazareth, Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is sporadic and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It's not just about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers warned about drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here," predicted Uri Schor, spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, in 2018.
Israel knows how to use technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital city of Jordan, Amman, there is an increase in tanker trucks.
Waterworks and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," reported tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman in September.
Clashes between farmers and security forces have erupted in the Iranian city of Isfahan.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The bed of the local river has completely run dry.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran.
The Israeli Minister of Defense stated that the negotiations in Vienna have brought "no progress" and that he informed Washington about preparations for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Czech source: Minister Benny Gantz declared on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, informs Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who is staying in the USA, is trying to convince Americans to increase their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear negotiations in Vienna have brought "no progress" and that world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them."
About 3 years ago, this also happened to me.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she actually wants from me.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of a pyramid scheme was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I kept questioning and doubting the lady for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Please tell me that I am a scoundrel, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers headed to the mountains over the weekend, where they found plenty of snow and nice weather.
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have therefore started operating.
The obligation to present a COVID certificate did not deter skiers.
While ski instructors do not complain about the lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental shops report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region headed to the running tracks and ski slopes over the weekend.
The skiers enjoyed the weather, which offered sunshine and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really turned out well starting from the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the slope," praised Jakub Hanuš, the director of the Ještěd Sports Area.
Hundreds of people set off for the first weekend skiing of the new season in the Jeseníky Mountains.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in Šumperk were open.
Weekend attendance was very decent, approximately 400 people came on Saturday and today.
The conditions are superb.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski resort in Branná, did not spare praise.
Operators of ski resorts can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are in the period after recovering from Covid-19.
With few exceptions, people are prepared for it and provide the necessary documents, said René Hroneš from the ski center Špindlerův Mlýn, according to ČTK.
"We have only recorded a few incidents," he added.
Some ski rental and equipment stores are reporting lower interest than before the pandemic.
Interest in renting skis is fortunately.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava store in Opava.
Greater demand is expected during the ski course season.
Also, the director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, David Šinták, feels that due to Covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
At this time before the pandemic, we were already almost exhausted.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said Šinták to ČTK.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to stay at home.
On the contrary, the rental service at Novako in Boží Dar is experiencing high demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and interested parties must now order them in advance.
"We will start renting skis this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a great interest, just like last year," said the operator of the area, Pavlína Nováková.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school, according to her.
If we want successful and wealthy people not to leave abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist healthcare, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here are leaving abroad.
The owner of the company will not just leave abroad.
I completely agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a prospect of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began when one beautiful day Orbán won, ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position overnight.
The next question is whether there will be elections at all.
When life here is bad, a traditional V4 lunatic can also win here.
Young and educated people will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot fit into an airplane will stay.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a bet on beer?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the film crew of the movie Ostrov, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury or is it just makeup for filming?
The London police are still searching for a missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are starting to worry about her a lot," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncova worked, in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28th around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was allegedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities stated in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also called upon to cooperate by MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the Srncova case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried sick," said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I have a feeling that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find it, because she was away from her homeland, away from her family, and worked here for our healthcare," Harmanova said.
The police previously detained one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
According to the news website BBC, however, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, certainly not with 30 BTGs (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to get fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you think that Russia wants war.
War is damn expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
Comparison with the situation in 1938 is so different in so many aspects that I don't even know where to begin.
I can already compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all and that would correspond to the "concentration" at the borders.
It, agreements must be kept...
New timetables will apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections.
Passengers in the Prague Integrated Transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, mainly concerning suburban connections.
New lines have been created, some have changed their route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice will stop at Zahradní Město station in the capital city.
In suburban train transport, trains S7 will depart, which pass through Prague main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently opened Prague-Zahradní Město station will now be served by the R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be expanded into other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy, and Turnov.
Buses in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions, will be incorporated.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and the operation of 12 existing lines will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Zličín in Prague and will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník has also been established, replacing the cancelled train line S53.
The morning peak and weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened, with the introduction of a new express line number 404.
Lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec region are now included in the PID system.
They depart from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
The main line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubá, and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doks, Mimoně and Jablonné v Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on ten local lines in the Central Bohemian region, including those to Mochov, Dobříš, and Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is canceled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 have been cancelled.
Due to railway modernization, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem, and Kolín area lines.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some canceled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk area have changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hello, I work the classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option for getting food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Given that I have no exercise, I don't have the strength to work out after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet-friendly as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I buy at most pizza buns and for a snack yogurt and an apple.
Question: What healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees you have to see necessarily.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can hide.
If it gets damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I do not claim that it is the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it is one of them.
Confession about the relationship with Nedvěd: I was not looking forward to this at all.
The Czech showbiz pond has been living for nothing else since Friday than the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since summer, the famous football player even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she kept her love hidden from them for six months.
"I dare to say that currently there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed the fact that Dara caught a bear, I mean, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
Apparently, he was the one who hit on her, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
That's what we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen, the singer continues.
I just don't know who is worse off.
If those who are not interested at all and it jumps on them even from a can, or us, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if someone wanted to hear your opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match, or if you insisted that everyone really knew in detail the list of your former partners and were familiar with the enumeration of your mistakes and faults.
That's obviously nonsense, you want it, Dara minds.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was going for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd is once again serving as the vice president of the football club Juventus.
They went out with the truth only now because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
With his wife Ivana, they have been separated for three years, but they are only legally separated for three weeks.
Anyway, we thank those who rejoice with us and wish us well.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We are not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
And that's why I love my new man, and just like he stands by me, I stand by him. In good times and bad, Rolins concluded.
Hello, other commenters have probably already said everything important, I just want to confirm that dormitories are great for the beginning. Most of my classmates usually get to know each other and make friends during the first semester or two, and then they find shared apartments together, which seems like the best option to me because you know who you will be living with.
Apartments are usually not advertised too far in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it won't hurt to look at the listings.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejl, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří quarter is very student-oriented, Královo Pole and in that direction it's nice, besides it's close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you're getting on).
I have never looked for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly advise on Brno itself if you still need any information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually completely fine that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it themselves, or let them follow the state and pay for it through the government.
We cannot let a private actor take control of a piece of education just because they add a few coins to the full state contribution and as a result, they will be able to teach whatever they want in schools.
Such a statement somewhat loses its weight when it is written by someone who expressed themselves in this way about a petition action for boycotting a totalitarian state two days earlier.
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
I would consult directly with the person who assigned you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitization that (even long-time professionals) either estimate it visually or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is, in this case it is quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it probably in a note according to what program you are using.
If you wanted to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from a book, I would guess that the author or printer simply created their own symbol that fits with what is physically on the coin.
PS: Isn't it rather the Odry Empire (kingdom) than the OdryN Empire?
PSS: someone has already figured it out here.

Politicians have no idea what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
This is much worse trouble than having interpreters with them.
The idea that something would be approved because no one understood a certain text is amusing.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, for which basic knowledge of English is not enough, that is a matter for lawyers.
In various EU institutions, there are hundreds of translators and interpreters, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with English it is quite interesting, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the hate towards Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and it's totally fine.
How many times do I go from work at 10 pm and never any problem.
Only someone who has barely set foot there in their life can say that it is a ghetto.
Yeah, most of the Roma population in Brno lives there, but all they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they shouldn't :D It's definitely not that I would be afraid to go out on the street there at night.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the city center, I would definitely go for it.
There are now many apartments that have been newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda or lover Gelemová like a stake in a fence!
Who will you spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dáda's wreath and Lucie definitely has one too, said the saxophonist to Blesk, confirming Patrasová's words that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently we met with Anička, Felix, and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I will be.
I buy gifts regularly and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably perfume.
"I am a gentleman," added Felix, who came to the music video premiere at Richman club himself.
I am here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I enjoy talking to, says Slováček, who was glad to have met Luďek Sobotka's wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, please explain it to me.
I don't know any other department that could be deployed in hospitals in crisis.
There are few police officers and they cannot afford it, the same goes for firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
The fact that our army is only capable of defending Ostrava is a disgrace to previous governments, not the army itself, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the countryside should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, there has been a decrease in water in mountainous and foothill areas, and even places where there has not been a shortage of moisture are experiencing lower rainfall.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts are also reinforced by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in relation to drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
It will be like this, I can barely stay on the ice in skates, I don't know anything about playing hockey and that tactic (that I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also completely crazy.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Llama China", losing by two goals even though you don't have to win every game is different than when it's tied.
But anyway, listening to Czech commentators who highlight what the referees notice or don't notice in both men's and women's hockey, it's all strange, but that's probably the case with all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsports like F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the other way around, it's like always different, and that Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million.
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The number of confirmed cases in the Czech Republic in the last 14 days is 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily number of deaths since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor for the British Health Security Agency, on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in Britain and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after infection and deaths occur about three weeks after infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson likely broke the law by organizing a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December when the lockdown was in place and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government defended that the quiz took place "virtually," via computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from the position of Prime Minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, the Johnson ministers organized numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them.
Paul Brand, editor of the commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won by a landslide in the general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the position of prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly events have unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting spring elections that could end Viktor Orban's twelve-year government.
They will be elections of pan-European significance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They will not be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because the last two elections under Orbán were not free either.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The latest one sounds like everyone can choose where they want to vote in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to transport voters from decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It used to be about how much Fidesz would win, not whether it would win, and whether it would also have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will gain more votes and mandates.
This is a big change for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to play even harder in an attempt to maintain power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the chairman of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, leaked to independent media, where he tells the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you are talking about?
Yes, this is one of those news.
Everything starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my parents mom doesn't have much patience, neither do I, dad has it for a long time, but then he explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I used to get very angry when I was little, to the point that I would lie on the ground in a fit and turn blue, they probably took me to the shower twice to calm down.
Sometimes they disciplined me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
Definitely, I also have tendencies to solve things with violence now, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to release my anger and when I was younger, I would sometimes slap my parents over the hand (so I wouldn't get hit too hard), so never anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is my explosiveness, but certainly upbringing also plays a role in it.
I'm afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and handle it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at that moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration. On the other hand, maybe every parent messes something up, it's probably not possible to not at least slightly mess up your children, so I don't blame them for it.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call them the ones who create laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you are afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
The main trial begins in Slovakia in the case of the four defendants accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She mobilized civil society, but also exposed the practices of accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connections to the top figures in Slovak politics and justice.
What significant breakthrough will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are to blame for this huge thing.
How is it possible that this petition received significantly more media attention than the counter-petition of all medical faculty deans, which was published a day or two later?

Another government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository is nowhere.
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised.
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is at the end and the law that was supposed to ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and permitting of deep repositories for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council has interrupted the discussion of a proposal that the Ministry of Industry and Trade submitted to the government after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against deep repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect a significant strengthening of their decision-making powers regarding the repository, as promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The municipalities primarily criticize the proposed bill by Minister Karel Havlíček, which Platforma has at its disposal, for the following reasons: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process regarding the selection of a site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure the respect of the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can truly be effective only if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to obtain the consent of the affected municipalities before initiating a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal of the subject matter intention almost completely neglects public involvement and reduces citizens of municipalities to mere statistics in permitting proceedings.
The design lacks a system setting for compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for a repository, its permitting, and operation.
Representatives of municipalities realistically do not have many options under current legal norms to defend the interests of their citizens when searching for a location for a repository.
Only in some permitting proceedings can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or minister whose interest is to issue the permit.
Any lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the implementation of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of local governments, which the Platform is requesting, is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries, and definitely in those where progress has already been made in permitting repositories, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and following the contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount for these works, according to the contract register, is nearly 4 million Czech koruna.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek area and spokesperson for the Platform against the deep repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only postponed the alignment of the position of local governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep repository for highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial construction project similarly to the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) with the aim of advocating for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep repositories only.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a site for potential storage should be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Czech source:Herce Johna Goodmana (69) donutil k hubnutí strach: Shodil 90 kg.English translation:Actor John Goodman (69) was motivated to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, doctors eventually scared him.
They told him that if he doesn't lose weight, he will die.
And it took it.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, informs the newspaper The Sun.
He showed off his new character at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers in Los Angeles.
The chubby guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I stuffed everything into my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview for AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit still anymore, said ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what context you want to use the word "boss".
If it's about some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, for example, a formal and perhaps university-level text, I would probably look for ways to describe or explain the boss more.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has several bosses, right, and so a "boss" is something like the lord/ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all in order for the game or level to be completed, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player doesn't directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), so can they be called bosses at all?
And then there are mini bosses.
It is simply impossible to translate the word "boss" in a one-word manner, neither Czech nor other languages solve it somehow (Catalan, for example, translates it as "final opponent").
It is simply significant for the story or game, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncova since December 3rd.
Even the Czech police got involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherské Hradiště has been missing since December 7th.
Interpol also helps the British police.
Czech source:Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28th.
The British police have been searching for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow notice because of her.
The whole world is therefore searching for Peter.
"The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police," confirmed police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has already been announced on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, slim, and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherské Hradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Czech source:Even local MP Harriet Harman joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in hanging flyers with Petra's face.
"We are extremely concerned about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decrease in attack campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approached, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are specifically targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the user's attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word "invoice" in its name, this time it was labeled as "Copy of repair receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
The spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is rising again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists intercepted campaigns with a global reach in November.
In comparison to October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still accounts for nearly one-fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th, and 15th of November.
The Formbook mostly contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was titled REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name "receipt" is still used.
The attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
Significant decline and decrease in activity are recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in the past few months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The procession in Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the shots of the procession along the waterfront and based on my experience, I estimate around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the embankment, the bridge, and the opposite embankment road.
This means that there are really a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the procession of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, and the like would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Chcípl pes association are gaining popularity, it reminds me of Milion chvilek pro demokracii turned upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what movement could be formed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the influx of money but also on whether the Pfizer triple-dose vaccine becomes a quadruple or multi-dose.
It definitely won't be a left-wing or centrist movement, bet on that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is evident that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
Brilliant action by scientists, which humanity rightfully takes pride in.
The end of the deadlock, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change.
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement "We Continue the Change" with forming a new government, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
The victorious parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power, however, were unable to reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The secretly taken shots are a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns grew about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been missing for several days and is being searched for by the London police.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the southern part of the British capital.
According to information about the employee of the children's hospital, in addition to the police, her current employer or the representative of a part of London where she lived also called.
"The disappearance of Petra is completely unlike her behavior and we are starting to worry about her a lot," said Lucy O'Connor from the police department in the Lambeth district, where Srncova worked, in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28th around 19:45 and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was allegedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by someone from her colleagues on December 3rd.
According to British media, Srncová worked as a "healthcare assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital group.
"We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of healthcare facilities stated in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
A Šumperk amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (also a regional Pirate Party councilor), was reported anonymously for violating copyright with her paintings.
The court, however, recognized that the paintings of Krteček in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there has been a hole in the road in the form of an uncovered canal for a month.
It was a matter of life.
The municipality referred complaints to the Road and Motorway Directorate, which owns the road, and because it allegedly did not respond, the pothole continued to gape.
Finally, the authorities clarified the responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the Road and Motorway Directorate (ŘSD) began to "intensively address the situation."
