Zhejiang University academic conference students take the lead in singing, research results are mind-blowing - Xinhua News
Using air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, accurately tracing the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students. The research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value. Some of these projects have already won awards both domestically and internationally.
Bio-sensor: Your family health check doctor
PhD student Zhang Diming's team from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a smartphone-sized biometric sensor on site.
"You just need to exhale gently, and this device can preliminarily detect your physical health condition from the composition of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets that can monitor health conditions on the market generally measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biological sensors uses a new material called graphene, whose target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" enables it to more profoundly and accurately reflect a person's health condition.
Intelligent surgical light: A doctor's high-energy eyes.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, have opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early enough, which is related to the lights used in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer screening, if doctors cannot promptly identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction between different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadow-free rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most using some soap or hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a set of "air handwashing devices".
As long as you stand on the device's washbasin, our body weight can compress the air and come out.
"Like a pump."
The compressed air forms fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
Colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove: The effectiveness of handwashing using this method is the same as using regular handwashing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can guarantee the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to make it up to me as soon as possible, thx.

Okay, thank you for your trouble.
A certificate that I think is meaningful - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates that I feel is important besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescues that are done in the event of a sudden incident, i.e. before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a time period before the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is during this time period that is the most crucial.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is so important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can save them through professional knowledge, instead of standing still and being unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, our official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, the national average is 15% able to be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it's less than 1%.
This is what Lele Lu, the founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, without breathing or a heartbeat, pressing the person's Zusanli (acupoint) has no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save someone's life.
I have discovered that very few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it will be too late when something happens. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react promptly when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can even save a person's life!
You can register for the first aid certificate at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can also enjoy discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25. Adding the CPR certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, and I actually completed it!
Next, I want to go and take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate. So, actually, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER##.
There is only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried
Why doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed out on delivering the food products, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because clearly I saw that the code I entered earlier was valid.
First of all, let me state my conclusion: in my opinion, "The Four Seas" is a completely terrible film in every sense.
But if you were to say that this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true. At least the music selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies. One type lulls you to sleep in the cinema, while another type leaves you indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
On the aspect of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly exceptionally talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the "Kruxi" novels, indescribable, with as many loopholes as the overcoat on Xiaomage's body.
You may even doubt whether there are metaphors implied by the director after finishing watching it, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of crap.
Let me briefly explain some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern region, relying on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an uncle in the neighborhood to drive her in a minivan to see snow in the northeast.
The elderly person of advanced age sits in a minivan and travels from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
Then the elderly person had no further news.
How did the male protagonist's brother get the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the motorcycle gang on the island easily block off a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop feels too obvious, right?
Why would a delinquent gang member with a bad credit history and suspected illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't you report to the police when facing usury? In the movie, the police even asked if there were difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner but ends up sleeping outside the room door for a night.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plot is so absurd that it pains me to even recall them.
Apart from the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie doesn't have a theme at all; it's just a grotesque patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think that it wants to be a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes, you guess that it might be an inspirational film. When you are halfway through, you feel like it might be a drama that aims to reflect the hardships of young people in small towns. After finishing it, you have no idea what you just watched, which is followed by a deep self-doubt. Why would you go to the cinema to appreciate feces on New Year's Day?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a movie about a motorcycle rider, it would be a combination of inspirational and comedic elements, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success.
If you want to shoot a romance film, then you should honestly tell the love-hate relationship between a motorbike-riding small-town youth and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, your plot should not involve things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the character played by Yin Zheng, whose new motorcycle just got burned, but can still sing), we cannot open up some imagination that even Kennedy would not be able to bear.
As for the female lead, she is clearly not mentally challenged but she behaves like a 5-year-old in certain aspects. I really don't know if this is because of her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing that I am quite puzzled about. As a race car driver, why is Han Han so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to make things difficult for the audience?

Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely applicable to new masonry materials for municipal underground structures such as coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas.
For example: various inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks, small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. related to drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the modules all have grooves, and they can be stacked together to form a chain-lock structure.
The shear resistance of the wellbore wall is much better than that of the flat friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure, with vertically connected holes after being combined and horizontally connected holes after being assembled. After the core of the hole is poured, it forms a cast-in-place concrete grid structure and plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The modules are designed with both horizontal and vertical strengthening slots, which effectively enhance the overall structural strength.
In addition, inspection wells and drainage wells built using concrete inspection well modules are not susceptible to collapse, sinking, leakage, and other phenomena. The mechanical performance of the well wall module is stable, operation is simple, and the forming dimensions are standardized.
The concrete inspection well modular brick machine equipment is equipped with intelligent control and data input and output devices. It has a one-click touch LCD display to monitor the entire mechanical operation process, achieving ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of ingredients, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall module mechanical hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integrated station, avoiding the impact of the host's vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment fabric box travels forward, the module box is demolded and rises, the material storage box door is closed, and the pallet is automatically conveyed, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers and electrical appliances, sealed hydraulic components, and guarantees stable and reliable comprehensive equipment performance.
The wall module of the well wall mechanical vibration platform adopts integral plate steel, and the tabletop is cut and molded without welding points, allowing the filling box to swing freely and reducing mechanical wear.

Chongqing Vocational School Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System, Admission is Employment as a Probationary Employee
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will simultaneously have the identity of apprentices and will be pre-registered as employees of pilot enterprises after admission.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardization of the enrollment and recruitment procedures of secondary vocational schools and corporate employees, clarifying the dual identity of apprentice students in secondary vocational schools and quasi-employees in companies. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and companies sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices aged 16 to 18, a four-party agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and company to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training of apprentices.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship and collaborate with partner companies to carry out pre-job training and job rotation training for company employees.
Pilot schools need to reform the talent cultivation model.
Jointly design talent training programs between schools and enterprises, jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot programs will have a trial period based on the cultivation of the education system, and the duration of student internships in enterprises will be determined according to the professional talent development plan, with a normal duration of 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal-level vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with around 50 students in each pilot project, for a total of about 3000 students (apprentices) trained.
According to the principle of piloting first and then promoting, and gradually advancing from point to surface, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively enhancing students' job skills, and improving students' employment rate and employment quality.

I have considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time and finally made up my mind to buy it. The dust suction effect is good and there is noticeably less dust in the house. The only downside is that it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand. The wet mopping function needs improvement as there are dust marks when going back and forth. Overall, I am still very satisfied.
The food processor is quite heavy, looks high-end, suitable for someone like me who is a novice in the kitchen. My child says it tastes better than what I cook myself. I have made two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes, and the sweet and sour pork ribs taste especially delicious. It takes a bit longer to make, but the rest of the dishes are quick to prepare. The noise is very low, so there's no need to worry about burning the food, and there's no need to worry about not knowing how to cook!
Received the goods and couldn't wait to stir-fry three dishes at noon. Technology really changes life. The control of heat and seasonings is precise, and the taste of the dishes is upgraded to the level of a master chef. Not bad, it's a magical tool for those who are not good at cooking. Recommended to purchase!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine that automatically controls the heat and stirs automatically.
No need to be afraid of being scalded by hot oil, and no need to be afraid of not controlling the heat well and burning or undercooking the food.
The dish that was stir-fried tastes much better than what I made. The stir-fried tomato and egg dish is especially flavorful, and the eggs have a particularly good texture.
This pot was well worth the purchase.
The item is good, worth buying, very good.
Overall very good, very clear, consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly transmissible but mostly causes mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder compared to the Delta variant, despite its faster transmission rate.
According to the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that the symptoms observed in the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and cough, similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization yet.
Pilai said, "They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are generally more prone to severe illness from coronavirus infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will have to be admitted to the hospital within a few days."
Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, only 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks had severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of the previous wave of the epidemic. The average length of hospital stay has decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate was 20% in the early cases during the outbreak in South Africa.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, stating, "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "Now it's still early stage, we need to obtain the later stage data."
In general, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only entered this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists from around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta remains the predominant variant of the novel coronavirus worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in Hauden Province has increased by 400%. Tests have shown that cases of the Omicron variant account for over 90%.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Education Review: What is needed to rescue abducted children?
If we make an analogy with the famous public service slogan "No business, no murder," then in a good environment without demand for "child abduction and trafficking," collective prevention, nationwide efforts against abduction, making the crime of trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Child Trafficking Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information about missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion," I immediately feel a warm sense of well-being.
The new technology not only has a creatively artistic name and is full of emotions, but is also applied in an appropriate and practical way, being useful and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to locate and rescue abducted children, ensuring their personal safety and freedom.
Next is the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated with many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
The importance and urgency of matters vary, and controversial topics such as whether child trafficking should be punishable by death penalty can be temporarily put aside for cautious discussion, but rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers usually tend to quickly move away from the crime scene after successfully carrying out their activities.
Every minute delayed in the search for a kidnapped child brings them one step further away from their parents, and increases the difficulty of solving the case by one point.
In this situation, taking out effective methods such as the "Reunion" platform that directly contribute to solving cases and retrieving children is indeed a practical action.
After all, "cracking down on human trafficking" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to be mobilized and well-operated.
Combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents require the implementation of "protecting the young and supporting the weak" from legislative improvements to judicial guarantees, as well as meticulous law enforcement.
In addition, more can be done to prevent child trafficking, from households to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three is taking a rest at the train station. The parents fall asleep and only wake up to discover that their child is missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, we should at least have a certain level of awareness for protecting them.
Parents taking turns to rest, or placing the child in a safe and secure environment, are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction.
From the perspective of the police cracking down on trafficking crimes, the buying side of the abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual illegal behavior is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking starts at 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, the death penalty can be applied, with confiscation of property.
The penalty threshold is high and the maximum punishment is severe. In the context of the overall trend towards lighter punishments, child trafficking is clearly a heavily punished crime.
Even now, there are still many cases of trafficking that occur every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward ideas about raising children and a weak awareness of the law.
Legal education for this group of people should be synchronized and followed up.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for child abduction exists extensively, the abductors will be driven by their own self-interest and constantly innovate their methods, leading to a situation of confrontation with law enforcement. As a result, anti-abduction efforts will inevitably become inefficient and mired in difficulties.

Yang Haodong answered each question in simple language and vivid examples. He earnestly urged young party members to draw strength from the Party's centennial struggle history, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, and resolutely follow the Party, using youth to dedicate themselves to write responsibility and take on responsibilities.

The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, with five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained directly from fresh olive fruits through mechanical cold pressing, filtration, and other treatments to remove impurities.
According to different acidity levels, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: It is the highest grade and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a subtle and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil (Fine Virgin): Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained after refining extra virgin olive oil with an acidity level exceeding 3.3%, or it is also known as "second-grade oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two grades:
Regular Olive Oil: Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to balance flavor and color. It has an acidity level below 1.5% and appears as a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from pomace through a dissolving method.
You should have noticed, after viewing the classification of grades, that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
To know, the olive fruit is just like grapes used for making wine. Olive fruits from different production areas and different olive fruit varieties will produce olive oil with different standards.
The best growing place for olive trees:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions, including temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation, for the growth of olive trees.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only sporadically grow in suitable habitats.
Main producing regions (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and there are also Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which have similar climates even though they are located far south.
The harvesting month of olive oil:
From March to June every year is the time when olive trees bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and ripen, transitioning from green to red, then purple, and finally turning black.
November to February is the harvest season for fruits (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in abundant monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
The democratic summit comes to a close, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy", convened by US President Biden and attended by government officials, leaders from civil society and the private sector from 110 countries around the world, came to a close on Friday, December 10th.
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every individual in the world, and no authoritarian regime can ever extinguish it.
He also stated that he plans to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative and political affairs commissioner Tang Fenghe and Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Law Kwun-chung, currently in exile in the UK, also delivered speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said: "We know how challenging the work in front of us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I have said before, as this summit demonstrates, democracy is everywhere in the world.
The authoritarian regime can never extinguish the small flame of freedom, as it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires collective efforts from the entire society.
He said, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the protective barriers of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and the power of those who seek power blatantly before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also stated in his opening speech that democracy is facing challenges globally, particularly from emerging digital technologies.
He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as the resilience of democracy."
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires strong condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a speech via pre-recorded video at the summit, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and in Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been witnessing China's rise, but there hasn't been a mechanism in place to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
"We must utilize everything (resources) at our disposal to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid of angering General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not realized the threat of the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values."
And that is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Minister Without Portfolio Tang Feng, while attending a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," released a video stating Taiwan's position on the forefront of fighting against authoritarianism and authoritarian rule, emphasizing its democratic values.
He also shared his experience of combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain steadfast at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments in various regions, under the pretext of public health and collective interests, justify violations of human rights, showing signs of global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without needing to lock down the city and we can overcome false information without needing to take down content.
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit," the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and several other countries for severe human rights violations. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company identified as aiding human rights abuses through surveillance technology.
I have taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time keeps getting postponed.
Originally wanted #NUMBER#
Anyway, I won't call anymore.
Not eating anymore
I will definitely complain.
You can't deliver it, why didn't you say it earlier?
Waited for you for so long.
No, I did not receive a call.
Please notify him to deliver it to our company again.

Hello, the saliva chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively affordable option to practice first.
Not friendly. In fact, prices are often directly proportional to the friendliness. If one cannot tell the difference, then expensive ones are usually more friendly than cheap ones. These so-called "entry-level paddles" are actually industrial waste.
Their strength is very low. When the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot. The hard ball cannot withstand it, and even experts find it difficult to control.
The logic and implied meaning behind their existence is: tennis is difficult, we know you won't be able to learn it and you won't want to spend a lot of money on it. So we'll just give you a cheap one to deceive you. After playing it a couple of times, you'll never play again, and you won't feel sorry for this cheap racket.
When you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. By that time, come to me and buy the expensive ones, and I will make money twice.
It is suggested to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, better-quality racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets don't sell for high prices, new rackets for 500 or 600 yuan are already very good, second-hand ones for 200 yuan, isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
Friendly to beginners, but becomes mediocre once you pass the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Can you please help me follow up?
Postpone
Thank you
That means, actually I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Can I ignore the previous order?

In fact, there are many considerations in terms of clothing matching for slightly chubby girls.
Girls with a fat body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the fat part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you can create a distinction between the upper, middle, and lower sections of your outfit, it will make you appear taller and give a natural increase in height. For example, using different colors for the upper body, skirt, and long stockings will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are essential for chubby girls (the author deeply understands this point). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body's chubbyness, and a noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black skirt, will make people feel that you are thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid people noticing your legs and feet and giving the impression of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to know the tips for dressing well.
Plump girls should never wear tight short skirts. In addition, the top should not be too short or tucked into the skirt, as it will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, wear black long stockings or mesh stockings (the kind with fine grids). Choose a soft floral skirt and pair it with a loose neckline top, which can effectively conceal the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, there are considerations for slightly chubby girls when wearing short skirts.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt so that it will give the illusion of added height to your chubby figure.
Matching a short skirt with high heels can make your legs appear longer. This is the trendiest combination for the summer!
If you have a chubby upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose glamorous and fancy one-piece short skirts.
Not only can it cover up your belly, but also highlight your advantages.
An A-line skirt will make you look slim, it is more suitable for overweight girls. The upper body should be tighter to create a layered effect and appear even slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt with a skirt, even chubby girls can give it a try.
Chubby girls can also wear a sense of fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching well, even slightly plump girls will become the center of attention.
After making changes in clothing matching, we must also exercise more in our daily lives, striving to rid ourselves of the label of being slightly chubby girls one day 😄

Girl becomes a human target to raise funds for her older sister: "Just thinking it's only a flesh wound is okay" - Xinhua Net
In Hangzhou's Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo titled "Hangzhou girl willingly becomes a 'target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board is written with the words "Human target, ten yuan per arrow," indicating that pedestrians can use bows and arrows after payment.
This behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police have confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move in order to raise donations for her sister. However, such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being cautioned, the girl has already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl fundraising on the street cautioned to stop
In the circulated image, a girl with long hair stands in the shape of the character "个" in front of a large wooden board. The board is written with black ink that says "human target, ten yuan per arrow". In front of her, another wooden board is written with her bank account, WeChat, Alipay account, etc.
The image sparked controversy after it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this behavior is a "begging act for attention", while many others express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation when we were patrolling near the square at around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. There were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
The police officer from the Tianshui Police Station near the scene said in an interview with local media that there were two girls selling goods on the stall, both around 20 years old, and they were dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who acted as a "human target" was crying all the time, begging passersby to play this game; the other girl next to her was helping to solicit, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone to help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the head of publicity at the Xicheng Branch of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Xinjing Daily that the girl's name is Jijiali and she is raising funds for her sister, Jijiayan.
But due to the fact that the treatment still requires over 300,000 yuan in expenses and not being able to think of a good way to raise funds for a while, they resorted to this behavior.
He said that throughout the whole process, one of the girls acted as the target while the other was responsible for assisting, but they did not participate actively. No one was found shooting arrows throughout the entire process. Some people were only watching and took pictures to post on Weibo.
After being assessed by the public security department, the bow and arrow used does not fall under the category of controlled items.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate the use of this sensational fundraising method."
After being warned by the local police station, she has already left the police station.
Heat dissipation performance: good Portability: convenient Appearance material: satisfied Acer has always had a high cost performance.
The new machine is very good.
Stable performance, four air outlets for heat dissipation without any problems, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid materials and a reliable brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not considered expensive.
I personally think that the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really good. Game performance: the game effects are smooth, and you can play most games comfortably. The frame rate of my PUBG is stable at high settings, very smooth. LOL is also no problem, and CS: GO is easy to handle. Most AAA games can be played.
Cooling effect: The cooling effect is good, the fan is very powerful, and it works quietly. Even with the game settings on full, the fan is still not small.
Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool and stunning, just like a gaming laptop.Display effect: The screen is very clear, playing games at 1080 is sufficient.
I think buying a laptop is pretty good, it's really great. It's mainly used for design, and has a high cost-performance ratio. It's lighter than expected and also more beautiful than expected. The red color on the back is a very nice wine color, not too garish. Overall, it surpasses my expectations by a lot. It's worth buying, and it's also suitable for girls.
Started using the Acer Dark Knight two years ago, after two years of usage, the cost performance is relatively high and the quality is excellent!
I also recommend my friends around me to buy this product!
Currently, three machines of this series have been purchased!
The appearance is beautiful and attractive, and the configuration is also very good.
I bought it for my nephew. I originally wanted to wait for the bank promotion on April 18th, but he needed it urgently, so I bought it in advance. Therefore, I missed the big bank promotion event, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost performance is quite high, and the logistics is also very fast. I will come back and give further reviews after using it for a while.
Brand new original, high cost-effective gaming laptop, the design style is very good, already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: Bought for children to use for 3D rendering, software is already installed, child says it can be used without any problem, this computer can perform 3D design work.

What's the hottest trend in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it is the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Some time ago, there was an article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Impact Olympic Medal-winning Events" that went viral. It mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects, with no one being able to match them: doing physical labor, going on business trips, and staying up late are all part of a project manager's daily routine, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing is just the norm.
A seemingly joking and teasing article, but it also reveals the daily hardships of project managers, representing their inadequate ability in current project management work.
