No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Doctoral student Zhang Diming's team from the School of Biomedical Engineering showcased an intelligent smartphone-based biosensor on-site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"smartphone-based" is a minor terminology/inconsistent use error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]"You just need to exhale gently, and this set of equipment can preliminarily detect your physical health status from the composition of the exhaled gas."
no errors[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone. After exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
"exhaling gas" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The smart bracelets available on the market can detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse, which can indicate the health condition.
"which can indicate the health condition" is a minor accuracy/addition error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material. Its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" enables it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of physical health.

"doctor's high-energy eyes" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions this year.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Master student Zhu Linjing and the team led by Shen Junfei in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"have opened up new ideas" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]"Many diseases are not detected and removed in the early stages due to inadequate use of lights in the operating room by doctors."
"by doctors" is a minor accuracy/omission error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Shen Junfei said, for example, in early cancer detection, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will continue to spread.
"then cancer cells will continue to spread" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This intelligent surgical light has four light discs to enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
"light spot" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as the Shao Yifu Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.

No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
"save water and cool" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing them with water, at most using some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhang and other classmates have invented an "air hand washing device".
"air hand washing device" is a minor terminology/inconsistent use error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]As long as we stand on the washstand of the device, our weight can compress the air and come out.
"device's" is a minor fluency/grammar error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]"Like a pump." is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Like this, we can wash our hands clean!
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The color reaction and residual bacteria experiments prove that the effectiveness of handwashing using this method is the same as that of regular handwashing methods.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free and energy-saving.
No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities around the world and won the only gold award.

"that I feel" is a minor accuracy/addition error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]```Just to clarify: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures that are taken in the event of a sudden incident, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.```
"Popularize it" is a minor style/awkward error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident occurs, and it is during this time that is the most crucial.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This is the time when emergency treatment is needed.
No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!

"pinching the person's acupuncture point between the nose and upper lip will have no effect" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to rescue someone.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]I found that very few people have this awareness of learning first aid now, but it's too late when things happen, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react promptly when faced with emergencies.
"but it's too late when things happen" is a major accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Maybe it can save a person's life!
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]You can register for a first aid certificate at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students even have discounts.

I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!

No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]First of all, let me state my conclusion: I personally think that "Four Seas" is a complete flop in every sense.
"Let me state my conclusion" is a minor fluency/grammar error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]"But if you want to say that this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true, at least the music selection is quite good."
no errors[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]There are many types of bad movies. One type is the kind that makes you fall asleep in the cinema, and another type is the kind that makes you outraged after watching it. "Sihai" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
"it" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]On the point of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly exceptionally talented.
"truly exceptionally talented" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the Kexi novels, hard to describe, full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Xiaoma's body.
"Kexi novels" is a minor terminology/inconsistent use error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Even after finishing it, you will wonder if there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you'll realize that it's actually a pile of shit.
"you'll realize that it's actually a pile of shit" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]First, let me briefly explain some plots that I find hard to understand.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The male protagonist should live on a small island in the southern part, relying on his grandmother for survival.
"for companionship" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man from the neighborhood to drive her in a small van to the Northeast to see the snow.
no errors[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Old people of advanced age taking a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
"Old people of advanced age" is a minor style/awkward error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]He and his father are still very confident about this.
"reassured" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Then the old man didn't say anything else.
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]How did the protagonist's brother obtain the business license for running a hotel on an abandoned ship?
"the protagonist's" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Why can the gang of thugs on the island easily close off a mountain road with flying cars?
"effortlessly" is a minor style/awkward error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere.
"that was" is a minor fluency/grammar error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This prop feels too obvious, right?
No errors.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Why would a small gangster with a bad credit history and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
"auxiliary police officer" is a minor terminology/inconsistent use error.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Why don't you report to the police when faced with usury? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
"whether there are any difficulties" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open a hotel room, and then forcefully arranges to stay outside the room all night without being able to find the hotel owner to sleep outside the room all night?

No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plots are so absurd that they even cause me distress when I recall them.
"the plots" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Apart from the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a hideous patchwork monster.
"what's even worse" is a minor fluency/grammar error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]At the beginning of the film, you might think that it wants to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you might guess that it might be an inspirational film. When you are halfway through, you might feel that it might be a drama that reflects the hardships of young people in a small town. After watching it, you don't have a clue about what you just watched. Along with that comes a deep self-doubt, wondering why you went to the cinema to appreciate feces on New Year's Day.

"you might think that he wants to make a comedy film" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error
"you may guess that it is perhaps an inspirational film" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error
"you may feel that it could be a drama that reflects the hardships of young people in a small town" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error
"you don't have a clue about what you just watched" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error
"wondering why you went to the cinema to appreciate feces on New Year's Day" is a major accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Most people are actually very familiar with the routines of various types of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, it should be an inspirational comedy that tells the audience how a talented rookie step by step achieves success.
"it should be" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]If you want to shoot a romantic film, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a young man who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress.
"and a waitress" is a minor accuracy/omission error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot cannot include things that are contradictory to the normal world.
"at the very least" is a minor accuracy/addition error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA](For example, like the character Yin Zheng played in the new motorcycle film, who had his motorcycle burned but could still sing), they can't come up with some mind-blowing ideas that even Kennedy couldn't withstand.
"they can't come up with" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error	"mind-blowing" is a minor style/awkward error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]As for the female lead, she is clearly not mentally disabled, but in some aspects, she behaves like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
No errors found.[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]There is one thing that I also can't understand. As a racer, why is Han Han so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes in his own movies?
"find it difficult to" is a minor fluency/awkward error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to make things difficult for the audience?

Students who receive pilot training will have the identity of apprentices at the same time. After enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises.
"secondary vocational schools" is a minor accuracy/mistranslation error[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]The Municipal Education Commission requires the standardization of enrollment and employment procedures for vocational schools, clarifying the dual identity of vocational school students and potential employees as apprentices. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and companies should sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and company to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching content, and guarantee of rights for on-the-job training of apprentices.

These two brands are not very well-known, so good rackets don't sell for high prices. It's good enough to have a new racket for 500 or 600 yuan. Second-hand ones are 200 yuan. Isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a racket worth thousands of yuan?
