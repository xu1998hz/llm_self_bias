Do we have a way to punish him? (literally: Is there a way to punish him?)
To prevent such incidents from happening again.
Will the restaurant still take a while to be ready? Could you please ask them to check for me? (Literally: "Is it still the case that the restaurant needs more time to prepare? Can you ask them to ask?").
At Zhejiang University Academic Conference, a student sang the lead role, leaving people's minds wide open with research findings - Xinhuanet.
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by exhaling breath, and precisely locating fog sources. Last night at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Meeting, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized. [
These achievements were mainly researched by students, with research covering areas such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value. Some projects have won awards in China and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor at Home
The team led by PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology at Beihang University showcased an intelligent biological sensor for mobile phones, which is about half the size of a mobile phone.
"You only need to take a light breath, this equipment can preliminarily detect your health condition from the components of the breath you exhale."
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this sensor suite connects to an intelligent phone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smartwatches on the market can detect health conditions, generally testing for temperature, pulse, and other physical parameters.
This set of biological sensor makes use of graphene, a new type of material, as its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect one's health condition.
Intelligent surgical lamp: A surgeon's high-tech eyes.
Besides intelligent phones, intelligent surgical lamps were also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master's students Zhu Linxing and Shulin Fei from the College of Optics and Electronics at Zhejiang University discovered a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp without shadows.
"Many diseases are not detected early enough or completely removed during surgery due to the lights used in the operating room by doctors."
Applicable to early cancer screenings, if doctors cannot clearly identify all tumor tissues in a timely manner, cancer cells will continue to spread afterwards, as stated by Shulin Jin.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has four discs, which can enhance the contrast of different organizations under the lighting through adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and opacity of the freckles according to the surgical requirements and individual preferences.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University Affiliated Children's Hospital, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention received the first-place award in the National Cup Competition.
Air dry hand washing: Save water and it's cool and trendy.
An ordinary person washes hands by using water to rinse, at most wiping a little soap or hand sanitizer. However, Li Qizhong and his peers invented a "air hand washing device".
Just standing on the washing basin of the equipment, we can compress the air and lose weight. (This sentence is not scientifically accurate and may be a metaphor or a figure of speech.)
It's like a balloon. (This is an idiomatic expression in Chinese, meaning something or someone is insignificant or has little power or influence.)
The compressed air forms a liquid at the water tap and mixes with water.
So, we can wash our hands clean this way!
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove: The effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity for operation, ensuring high cleaning efficiency while saving 90% of water, and the entire process is zero energy consumption, energy-saving and eco-friendly.
Last year, at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and received the only gold award.
Please arrange for a replacement as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and refund the money, no points, will not use #PRS\_ORG# again!
Spicy and bone-in stewed vegetables are not suitable for young children to eat.
If it is so, please order as soon as possible.
Temporarily unavailable, thank you. (This is a common response in Chinese and English when something is not immediately available or accessible.)
He called me to tell us where he is#PRS\_ORG#
I can't wait any longer, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the address wrong #PRS\_ORG#.
Can it be changed? (This is a direct translation of the Chinese text "可以更改吗?" which means "Can it be changed?" in English.)
Or cancel the order.
Okay, I'm done. (This is a common expression in Chinese used when one is finished with a task or interaction.)
A certificate that feels very meaningful - First Aid Certificate.
This is one important skill certificate besides my driving license for me!
Let me explain: First aid measures actually refer to emergency rescue before the arrival of an ambulance, that is, rescue before being taken to the hospital.
It is well-known that there is still a certain period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is precisely during this period that things are most critical.
This is the time when emergency rescue is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest, our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important for those around you to know how to administer first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there motionlessly and helplessly, which is a terrifying feeling.
In China, there are approximately 300,000 unexpected deaths from official data every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac stoppages.
In the United States, on average, only about 15% can be saved. [
In Las Vegas casinos, about 70-80 percent can be saved, but Shanghai and Beijing have a below 1% chance.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of the first response, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest and has stopped breathing and has no heartbeat, compressions on the chest will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and external chest compressions in order to save a person.
I have found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid at the moment, but when an emergency occurs, it's too late. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react promptly when faced with sudden situations.
Who knows, it might even save a life!
First-aid certificates can be registered at the Red Cross training centers in your local area. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are still student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of a goal that I had to complete before turning 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also something that happened a few months ago, but I really did accomplish it!
Next, I'm going to take other exams I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate, and I saw on Little Red Book that there's also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take the scuba diving certificate exam, so in fact, a first aid certificate is quite useful!
I have ordered ##NUMBER#.
There are only 13 yuan for a plate of shrimp dumplings? (One plate costs 13 yuan for shrimp dumplings?)
I haven't tried it.
How come #NAME# is not clear?
One costs 13 yuan.
Yesterday #PRS\_ORG# sent me the wrong food order again, just a shrimp dumpling this time!?
Because I saw that the code I entered before was valid.
First, I would like to state my personal opinion that "Four Seas" is a disappointing film in all aspects.
If you're saying this movie doesn't have any bright spots, that's not necessarily a bad thing at least for the background music selection.
Popcorn comes in many varieties, one that lets you doze off comfortably in the cinema, and another that leaves you filled with righteous indignation after watching. The film "Four Seas" for the audience is like the monkey on Mount Huangshan, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of humiliating the audience, Han Han is indeed a natural-born genius. (This is a comment about Han Han's performance or behavior towards the audience)
This movie makes people feel the most painful because it seems like a character from a Clan novel, hard to describe, full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Smallpox Brother.
Even after watching it through, you may doubt if there are hidden symbols from the director, but upon careful thought, you find it's just a pile of manure.
First, I'll explain some parts that I find difficult to understand. (In Chinese: 先简单说下有些情节我很难理解)
The man's residence should be on a southern island, where he is deeply dependent on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow. The plot then arranged for a neighbor, an old man, to take her in a small bread cart to the northeast to see the snow.
An elderly person riding on a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow? This sentence seems a bit unusual and may not have a clear meaning without additional context. It could be a metaphorical expression or a figure of speech, but it's hard to translate it literally without knowing the intended meaning.
He and his father are very reassured about this.
And then this old man had no more text.
Opening a restaurant on an abandoned ship, how did the female lead and her brother obtain the business license?
Why can the small thugs of the Island Aircraft Party easily block a mountain road with just a few vehicles?
Then in the middle of the road, a truck carrying steel beams came to a stop. None of the truck drivers around could be found.
This gadget is quite obvious, isn't it? (This gadget is quite clear, isn't it?)
A small gangster with a bad credit record and a criminal record became a reserve officer in the aviation corps? (This sentence seems to imply that it's unusual or questionable how someone with a criminal record and poor credit became a reserve officer in the aviation corps.)
Why didn't the police report high-interest loans in the face of it, and the movie specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key in a hotel and then arranges to find the hotel owner who is not available, and sleeps outside the door for a night?
This kind of bizarre scene pervades the entire film, and the memories of them make me feel painful and distressing when I recall them.
Besides the plot, even worse is the theme of the movie, or to put it bluntly, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a monstrous patchwork of unappealing elements.
The beginning of the video makes you think he's making a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it could be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you think it might be about the struggles of small-town youth. When you finish, you're left wondering what you actually watched, and New Year's Day finds you doubting yourself for having spent it at the cinema.
For most people, various movie plots are quite familiar, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle gang, it's about inspiring and adding humor to tell the audience how a natural-born loser gradually steps towards success.
If you want to make a love story film, then you should talk about the complicated entanglements of affection between the young man from a small town who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister honestly.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't contain anything contradictory to the real world.
(For example, the new motorcycle of Yan Zhengwen's performance was burnt down, and yet he could still sing. I can't help but have a wild imagination like JFK.)
As for the female lead, she clearly wasn't dumb, but in some aspects she acted like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if it was an acting technique or the director's requirement.
I still don't quite understand one thing: Why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes in his own movies?
This kind of movie arrangement in the Chinese New Year box office, is it to obstruct the audience? (Literally: Is it to add obstacles for the viewers in the Chinese New Year box office?)
