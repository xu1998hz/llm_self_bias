Zhejiang University students' research results impress the audience, causing a sensation - Xinhuanet
Use air to wash your hands, judge diseases by breathing, and accurately search for the source of haze - At the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Conference last night, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education, from a curious starting point, they have created many high-end inventions with practical applications, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological sensors: your family doctor
A team of doctoral students from the Biomedical Engineering Institute has displayed a smart biomedical sensor on a mobile phone, with a size of only half of a smartphone.
"Just breathe lightly into this device, and it can initial assess your physical health condition from the gas exhaled from your breath."
Zhang Dingming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will appear on the phone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and heart rate.
This biotech sensor uses a new type of material called graphene, which can detect chemical elements with great sensitivity, allowing for more accurate and in-depth monitoring of physical health.
Smart surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights have also been introduced in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at this year's 44th Swiss International Invention Fair.
Zhu Jing, a master's student at the College of Optoelectronics and Computer Science, and her team have opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical lamps.
Many diseases can be detected early and removed if the light in the operating room is adjusted properly.
For example, during early screening for cancer, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissues clearly, the cancer cells may still spread.
This smart surgical light has four light pads, which can enhance the contrast of different organs under different light spectra.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, color, and uniformity of the light source based on the surgical needs and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Innovation Cup.
Wash your hands with air: save water and look cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water and soap, at most rub a little hand sanitizer, but Li Keqiang and his classmates invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as you stand on the weight-measuring device, we can compress the air and make it weigh less.
"Just like a breath of fresh air."
Compressed air forms a liquid when it comes into contact with water.
That way, we can wash our hands clean!
The results of the experiment show that the effectiveness of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand-washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness of the process and save 90% of water, with zero energy consumption and environmental protection.
Last year, this invention stood out among many top universities worldwide and won the only gold award at the Second Global Grand Challenge Conference.

A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the most important skill certificates besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken before the arrival of an ambulance, not after.
As everyone knows, there is a critical period after the accident when the rescue vehicle arrives, and this period is the most crucial.
This is a time when we need urgent help.
If I were to have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or stop breathing, then our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's important to know first aid near you!
When someone falls down next to us, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, doing nothing, which feels too scary.
In China, we have official data that shows that three hundred thousand people die unexpectedly every year, with the most dangerous being heart attacks.
The average survival rate in the United States is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos, 78% of people can be saved, while those from Shanghai and Beijing have a lower success rate of less than 1%.
This is the first reaction of the founder of the company, Lu Leshoutong.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest and stops breathing, with no heartbeat, CPR is useless.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to have a chance of saving the person.
I found that few people now have the awareness to learn this skill, but when the situation arises, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations.
It's not definite that you can save a person's life!
The first aid certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals you want to achieve before you turn 25, and the rescue certificate is also included in the list of goals, but it is indeed completed!
After that, I want to take other certificates that I want to take, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is a diving emergency certificate, and I think it's useful to have this certificate before I take the diving test, so I'm going to take it!

First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a complete failure, both in terms of its artistic and commercial values.
But you have to admit that this movie is not a highlight, and the music is not very good either.
There are many types of movies, and each one can make you feel differently. Some movies can make you feel angry, while others can make you feel relieved. The movie "Four Seas" is like a monkey on a mountain, it can use countless methods to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Hong is truly a natural talent.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems like a creation from a novel, with many flaws and loopholes, just like the windbreaker on a little boy's body.
Even after watching it, you may wonder if there is a hidden metaphor in the director's intentions, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is actually just a pile of rubbish.
Let's start with some simple explanations of difficult situations.
The male protagonist's residence should be on a small island in the southern region, where he depends on his grandmother for everything.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow and the plot is arranged for a neighbor who drives a small bread car to take her to the northeast to see snow.
Elderly people sitting on a bread cart from the south to the northeast to see snow?
They were very relaxed about it.
Then the old man just disappeared.
How did the female protagonist obtain a business license to open a bar on an abandoned ship?
Why can a group of island car drivers easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and the drivers of the surrounding cars were all looking for it.
This is too obvious, right?
Why would a reckless and law-breaking small gang leader become a auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't the high-interest loan report any difficulties, and the police even asked specifically in the movie if there were any problems?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use the hotel room card to open the door and then forces the hotel owner to let them stay in the room?
The strange and absurd plot fills the entire video, making me feel painful whenever I recall it.
Besides the plot, the movie's theme is even more disappointing, or rather, the movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a messy and chaotic work.
At first, you may think it's a comedy film, but after 20 minutes, you may feel it's an inspirational film. Halfway through, you may think it's a film about the struggles of young people in a small town, and after watching it, you'll be left wondering what you just watched. This uncertainty will lead to self-doubt and the question of why you wasted your time watching it.
For most people, it's actually quite familiar with the plots of various movies, such as if you want to make a motorcycle movie, you can add a touch of comedy and tell the audience how an ordinary chicken can step by step achieve success.
If you want to make a romantic movie, you should sincerely describe the love and hatred between the young people in the small town and the service staff.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your emotions cannot contradict the normal world.
For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zhiyuan just bought and then sang a song, it's not possible to resist the temptation to open it and take a look.
As for the female lead, she is not weak-willed and can show remarkable abilities in certain aspects, but I don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
This movie schedule during the Spring Festival season, is it just to add burden to the audience?
