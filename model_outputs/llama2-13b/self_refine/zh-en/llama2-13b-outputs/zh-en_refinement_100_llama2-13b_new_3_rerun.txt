Is there a way to hold him accountable?
To prevent similar situations from arising again.
"How much longer until the restaurant is ready? Can you help me ask?"
Zhejiang University students' research results leave audience in awe, causing a sensation - Xinhuanet.
"Using breath analysis to diagnose diseases and accurately locate sources of haze, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Conference last night."
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, covering a wide range of fields including environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. From a curious starting point, they have created numerous high-end inventions with practical applications, some of which have received awards both domestically and internationally.
"Biological sensors: your family doctor"
A team of doctoral students from the Biomedical Engineering Institute has displayed a smart biomedical sensor on a mobile phone, with a size of only half of a smartphone.
"Just breathe lightly into this device, and it can initially assess your physical health status from the breath you exhale."
Zhang Dingming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health data will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and heart rate.
This biotech sensor utilizes graphene, a novel material, to detect chemical elements with exceptional sensitivity, enabling more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of one's physical health.
"Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's keen eyes"
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lamps have also been introduced in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at this year's 44th Swiss International Invention Fair.
"Zhu Jing, a master's student at the College of Optoelectronics and Computer Science, and her team have discovered new possibilities in the limitations of traditional surgical lights and invented smart LED surgical lamps."
"Many diseases can be detected and removed if the lighting in the operating room is adjusted properly."
For example, during early screening for cancer, if doctors cannot clearly visualize all the tumor tissues, the cancer cells may still spread.
This smart surgical light has four light panels that can adjust the wavelength of light to enhance the contrast between different organs during surgery.
During surgery, the surgeon can adjust the size, brightness, and color of the light source based on the surgical needs and personal preferences, ensuring optimal illumination and minimizing shadows.
This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Innovation Cup.
"Air-wash your hands: save water and be stylish"
Ordinary people typically wash their hands with water and soap, at most rub a little hand sanitizer, but Li Keqiang and his classmates invented a "hand hygiene device" that uses air to clean hands.
As long as you stand on the weight-measuring device, we can compress the air and make it weigh less.
"Just like a breath of freshness."
Compressed air forms a liquid when it comes into contact with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
The results of the experiment show that the effectiveness of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand-washing methods.
This device utilizes gravity as the driving force, ensuring a clean process while saving 90% of water and featuring zero energy consumption, all while being environmentally friendly.
Last year, this invention stood out among numerous top universities globally and won the sole gold prize at the Second Global Grand Challenge Conference.
"Please arrange for a replacement as soon as possible, thank you."
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, without accumulating points. We will never use this service again!
"Spicy and oily food is not suitable for kids to eat."
"If so, please proceed with the order as soon as possible."
Not available at the moment, thank you.
He told me to tell you where he is.
"I've changed my mind, cancel the order."
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
"Cancel order"
Okay, no problem.
"A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate"
This is one of the most important skill certificates aside from my driver's license!
Spread the word: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken before the arrival of an ambulance, not after. The correct term is "pre-hospital care" or "pre-hospital emergency care."
As widely known, there is a critical time window after an accident that is crucial for rescue efforts.
This is a critical moment and we need immediate assistance.
If I were to have a heart attack, stroke, or my breathing were to stop, then our window of life would only be four minutes. The golden four minutes!
So it's important to know first aid near you!
When someone is injured or in distress next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to provide assistance instead of standing idly by, feeling powerless, which is terrifying.
In China, official data shows that approximately 300,000 people die unexpectedly every year, with heart attacks being the leading cause of sudden death.
The average survival rate in the United States is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos, 78% of people can be saved, while those from Shanghai and Beijing have a lower success rate of less than 1%.
This is the first reaction of Lu Leshoutong, the founder of the company.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest and stops breathing, with no signs of heartbeat or pulse, CPR would not be effective.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to have any chance of saving the person's life.
I found that few people now have the awareness to learn this skill, but when the situation arises, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations.
"It's not certain that you can save a person's life!"
"You can register for the first aid certificate at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts available for students."
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals you want to achieve before you turn 25, and the rescue certificate is also included in the list of goals, but it is indeed completed!
After that, I plan to take other certifications that I'm interested in, such as a diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's a diving emergency certification, and I think it's useful to have this certification before I take the diving test, so I'm going to take it!

Based on my personal opinion, "Four Seas" is a comprehensive failure, falling short of both artistic and commercial standards.
But you have to admit that this movie is not a standout, and the soundtrack is not particularly impressive either.
There are many types of movies, and each one can evoke a different emotion. Some movies can make you feel angry, while others can leave you feeling relieved. The movie "Four Seas" is like a mischievous monkey on a mountain, using countless tactics to ignite your passion and fury.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Hong has a remarkable talent.
The most painful aspect of this movie is that it feels like a fictional creation, with numerous flaws and plot holes, much like the windbreaker on a child's body.
Even after watching it, you may wonder if there is a hidden metaphor in the director's intentions, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is actually just a pile of rubbish.
Let's start with some straightforward explanations of complicated situations.
The male protagonist's residence should be on a small island in the southern region, where he is closely tied to his grandmother.
Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and the plot is arranged for a neighbor to take her to the northeast in a small car to see snow.
Elderly people riding a bread cart from the south to the northeast to see snow?
They were very comfortable with it.
Then the old man just disappeared.
How did the female protagonist obtain a license to open a bar on an abandoned ship?
Why can a group of car drivers from the island easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped on the side of the road, and the drivers of the surrounding vehicles were all looking for it.
This is way too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a reckless and law-breaking individual become a auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't the high-interest loan report any difficulties, and the police even asked specifically in the movie if there were any problems?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use the hotel room card to open the door and then forces the hotel owner to let them stay in the room?
The bizarre and nonsensical plot permeates the entire video, causing me to feel a sharp pain whenever I think about it.
Besides the plot, the movie's theme is even more disappointing, or rather, the movie lacks a clear theme altogether, it's just a disjointed and chaotic work.
At first, you may think it's a comedy film, but after 20 minutes, you may feel it's an inspirational film. Halfway through, you may think it's a film about the struggles of young people in a small town, and after watching it, you'll be left wondering what you just watched. This uncertainty will lead to self-doubt and the question of why you wasted your time watching it.
For most people, it's actually quite familiar with the plotlines of various movies, such as if you want to make a motorcycle movie, you can add a touch of comedy and show the audience how an ordinary chicken can step by step achieve success.
If you want to make a romantic movie, you should sincerely depict the love and conflicts between the young people in the small town and the service staff, such as the bartender or waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your emotions cannot contradict the normal world.
For example, after Yin Zhiyuan bought a new motorcycle and sang a song about it, it's hard to resist the urge to open it up and take a peek.
As for the leading lady, she's not weak-minded and can display impressive skills in certain areas, but I'm unsure if this is due to her acting abilities or the director's guidance.
I also don't quite understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on including car crash scenes in his own movies?
This movie schedule during the Spring Festival season, is it just to add burden to the audience?
