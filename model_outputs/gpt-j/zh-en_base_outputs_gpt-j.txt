Is there any way to punish him?
To avoid such a thing happening again

The University of California, Davis, student choir sang the lead role in a research project, which opened the brain's mind - Xinhuanet
Use air to wash your hands, and check for flu symptoms. Find the source of the fog. Yesterday evening, at the 2016 academic year opening ceremony of the Jiangsu University, a series of academic achievements were awarded.
These achievements are mainly the work of students, who have covered the environment, machinery, energy, health, life sciences, humanities, and other major areas. From a good question point, they have created many high-end inventions with great application value. Some of these projects have been awarded with international prizes.
Biological Sensor: Your family doctor
The team from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Hong Kong has developed a biosensor that can be attached to a smartphone.
“You only need to lightly breathe in and out, and this instrument will detect the oxygen content in your breath, and roughly assess your health condition.”
Zhang Di introduces that this sensor is connected to the smart phone, and after the gas is released, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
A smart bracelet that can detect your health condition on the market, usually it detects temperature, pulse, etc.
And this set of biological sensors uses a new material, which is a kind of carbon, and it is sensitive to chemicals, and it can detect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart Eye Surgery: Doctor's High-Power Eye
Besides smart phones, the operating room also uses smart surgical lights.
This invention has been awarded the Gold Medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition.
In the absence of traditional surgical light, the team of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has invented a new surgical light without shadows.
“Many diseases are detected early, but not removed, and the light bulb used in the operating room is related to the doctor.”
Dr. J.S. Huang said that if a doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in the early stage of cancer, then the cancer cells will spread.
This smart light has four light panels, and through adjusting the spectrum, it can enhance the difference between different organizations under different light conditions.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color, and uniformity of the shadows according to the individual's preferences and habits.
This smart lamp has been tested in Jiangsu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Children's Hospital, and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention was awarded the National Challenge Cup.
Wash hands with water: cool and fancy
Regular people wash their hands with water, and use soap to wipe their hands, and squeeze out some hand soap. While Lei Wang and others invented a "air-washing device"
As long as you stand up the hand dryer, our weight can be compressed out of the air.
“It’s like a cigarette lighter.”
Compressed air forms a fluid at the mouth of the dragon.
So, we can wash our hands clean!
The demonstration of the color reaction and the bacteria residue experiment proves that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as the regular method.
This device only needs to be driven by our own gravity as the driving force, and can be cleaned to a high degree, and can save 90% of the water, and the whole process is completely without energy consumption, and is energy-saving.
Last year, in the second global challenge summit, this invention was the only one to win the gold medal in many world-class universities.

A certificate that is very meaningful - Emergency certificate
This is one of the important skills certificates that I have besides driving a car!
Introduce: Emergency rescue measures are actually emergency rescue measures for the time of an incident, which is before the rescue vehicle arrives.
As is well known, after the accident, the rescue vehicle came in a short time, and it was during this time that the most important thing happened.
This is the time when we need to rescue them.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, or a brain hemorrhage, then my life's window is only four minutes, four minutes of gold!
So, the importance of having people around you who know how to help in an emergency is so great!
When we are around someone who has fallen down, we can rescue them through professional knowledge, instead of standing there and doing nothing, which is a useless feeling.
“In China, official statistics show that every year there are three hundred million people who die of heart attacks.
In the United States, on average, 15% of people can be saved.
In Las Vegas, the odds of surviving are seven out of ten.
This is the first response from the founder of the company.
If a person has a heart attack, breathing stops, and heart beats stop, there is no effect.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compressions to have a chance of saving a person.
I found that we are not very many people who have this awareness to learn rescue, but when the situation happens, we are not able to react, so I would like to ask everyone to learn this skill, so that we can be able to react timely when the situation happens.
Maybe we can still save a life!
The Red Cross can be contacted at your local Red Cross center, I am contacting the Red Cross at the Pearl River Delta Red Cross center, and students can get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of my 25 years old self, and adding the emergency card to the target list is something I did a few months ago, but I did it!
Next, I need to go to the other certificates that I want to take a test for, and I plan to take a diving test, so I need to take a diving certificate first, and I think it's still useful to have a diving certificate!
I ordered #NUMBER#
Is that a single lobster for 13 yuan?
I have not tried

First, I think that "Four Seas" is a complete failure, from various perspectives.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight either, and it's not at least a good soundtrack.
Bad film is a lot of different kinds, let you feel the excitement of the cinema after watching it, let you feel the anger after watching it, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on the top of Mount Everest, it can light up your anger with a lot of different ways.
In an attempt to insult the audience, the pilot is really a god-like person.
This film is the most painful one in the world, it is like a creation in a novel, it is hard to name, it is like a windy coat on a little horse.
Even after watching the whole thing, you will wonder if there is a hidden meaning in it, but when you think about it, it is just a pile of shit.
I'll try to explain some of the more complicated parts of the story.
The male head of household should be located on a small island in the south, and his grandmother should be his guardian.
She wants to see snow, and the story is that a neighbor opens a small bakery and drives her to the north to see snow.
Is the elderly man sitting on a sandwich car from the south to the north?
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then this old man just left without a word.
On the junk, how can the owner get a liquor license?
Why can't the island's police force just lighten up and make a roadblock?
Then the car with the steel cable stopped at the side of the road, and the car driver couldn't find any other car.
This tool is too obvious.
Why would a small-time gangster be a police officer?
Why don't you report high interest rates? Why did the police ask if there was a difficult situation?
A grown-up person knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to use a room key at a hotel, and then forcefully arrange to find the hotel manager, who is sleeping in the room outside?
These events are so bizarre that they are all over the entire movie, and because of the events being too bizarre, I will always remember them when I think about them.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about this film is that it has no plot, or that it has no plot at all, it's just a horrible mess of a film.
At the beginning of the video you will think that he wants to make a comedy film, 20 minutes later you will think that it might be a drama film, half way through you will think that it might be a film about a young person who struggles to survive in a small town, after watching it you will not know what you have watched, and you will have a deep sense of doubt about yourself.
For most people, it's actually very familiar with the patterns of most types of movies, like if you want to make a motorcycle driver, then you have to have a story and comedy, and then tell the audience that a talented bird is how to step by step get to success.
If you want to make a romantic movie, you should talk about the love between the young people of the small town and the girl who serves them.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your story cannot be similar to the normal world.
(For example, the role of the character who sings in the movie "The Martian" was burned, and then he could not open some of the brain cells that were not able to withstand the heat.)
As for the female lead, she is not weak in any way, but she is a 5-year-old child in some ways, and I really don't know why this is a performance or why the director wants this.
There is one thing I don't understand too, why is it that the Korean actor, Kim Woo-sung, is so passionate about adding car crashes to his own movies?
This movie is scheduled to be released during the Chinese New Year, is it to block the audience?
