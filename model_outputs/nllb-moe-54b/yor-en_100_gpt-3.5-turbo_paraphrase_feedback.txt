Translation: ```Urumqi Home Furnishing Store Channel provides you with the latest bussiness information such as the address, telephone number, bussiness hours, etc., of high-speed rail, and find a decoration company, and go to the reviews.```

MQM annotations:
- "of high-speed rail" is a critical accuracy/addition error. There is no mention of "high-speed rail" in the source text, and it is not relevant to the context of a home furnishing store.
- "find a decoration company, and go to the reviews" is a major accuracy/mistranslation error. The meaning is not accurately conveyed from the source text. It should be something like "find a decoration company, go to Dianping for the reviews."

Translation: ```Ich entschuldige mich dafür, wir müssen die Erlaubnis einholen, um eine Bestellung mit einer anderen Person zu besprechen. Ich entschuldige mich, falls dies zuvor geschehen wäre, aber ohne die Erlaubnis des Kontoinhabers wäre ich nicht in der Lage, dies mit dir involvement.```

MQM annotations:
- "involvement" is a major accuracy/mistranslation error. It should be "ohne die Erlaubnis des Kontoinhabers wäre ich nicht in der Lage, dies mit Ihnen zu besprechen," which means "without the account holder's permission, I would not be able to discuss this with you."
- "the account holder" is a major accuracy/omission error. It should be "Erlaubnis des Kontoinhabers," which means "the account holder's permission."
- "wäre" is a minor fluency/grammar error. It should be "wäre ich nicht in der Lage," which means "I would not be able to."
- "dir" is a minor fluency/register error. It should be "Ihnen," which means "with you."

Translation: ```Ve Vídni se ve Vídni obnovily rozhovory o oživení jaderného paktu, přičemže obě partaje se snaží posoudit vyhlídky na úspěch po posledních výměnách v jednáních.```

MQM annotations:
- "ve Vídni" is a major accuracy/addition error. It means "in Vienna" and is repeated unnecessarily.
- "the stop-start" is a major accuracy/omission error. The phrase is not translated properly, and the meaning is lost.
- "partaje" is a minor terminology/inappropriate for context error. It should be "strany," which means "sides" or "parties."
