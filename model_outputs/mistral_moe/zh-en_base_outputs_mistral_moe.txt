Is there a way to punish him?
In order to prevent such an incident from happening again.

At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students sang the lead role and the research results opened up people's mind - Xinhuanet
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by exhaling, accurately searching for the source of haze.
These achievements were mainly researched by students, with research covering various fields such as the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your family doctor.
The team of PhD student Zhang Diming from the College of Biomedical Engineering showed an intelligent mobile phone-based biosensor on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"All you need to do is gently exhale, and this equipment will be able to preliminarily detect your body health status from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling gas.
Intelligent wristbands that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new type of material, with its target being chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Smart surgical lamp: Doctor's high-energy eyes - This is a creative way to describe a smart surgical lamp as the "eyes" of the doctor, providing high energy and precision during surgery.
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions this year.
Postgraduate students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early due to the light used in the doctor's operating room."
Shēn Jùn fēi shuō, bǐrú ài zhēn zǎoqī jiǎnchá shí, yīshēng rúguǒ bù néng jíshí kàn qīng suǒyǒu zhǒng zhēng zhī, nàme zhīhòu aì xī zhī hái kuòsàn.
This intelligent surgical light has four light plates, which can enhance the difference in illumination of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot as needed and according to personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical light has been trialed at the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and other hospitals, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Use air hand wash: saves water and is cool - English translation of Chinese text
An ordinary person washes their hands with water and at most uses a little soap and hand sanitizer, while Li Qiang and his classmates invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as you stand on the device's sink, we can compress air and release it. (This seems to be referring to a specific device or machine, but the exact meaning is unclear without more context.)
"It's like a pump to boost morale." (Literally: "It's like a gas pump.")
Compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet, which combines with water.
Then, we can wash our hands clean! (This is a sentence completion, the beginning of the sentence is missing)
Experiments on staining reactions and bacterial residue have proven that the effect of washing hands in this way is no different from that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleaning level while saving 90% of water, and the entire process is completely waste-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class institutions and won the only gold award.
Please arrange for me to return as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, not the points. I will not use #PRS\_ORG# in the future!
Spicy soup and bones are not suitable for small children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you. (This is a literal translation, the actual meaning might depend on the context)
He told me to tell you his location.
I'm not waiting anymore, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can I change it?
Cancel order
Okay, thank you. (This is a polite way to say "you're welcome" in Chinese)
A certificate that is considered to be very meaningful - a first aid certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, besides my driver's license!
Let me clarify: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken in the event of a sudden incident, that is, rescue efforts before the arrival of an ambulance.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between when the accident occurs and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time to provide emergency aid.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory failure, then we only have four minutes of life, the golden four minutes!
So, knowing how to perform first aid on someone nearby is so important!
When someone collapses next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than standing there motionless and unable to do anything, as the feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
In China, our official data shows that there are 3 million unexpected deaths each year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% of people are able to be rescued.
In Las Vegas casinos, 78% can be saved, while it is below 1% in Shanghai and Beijing. (Note: The percentage of gamblers who can be saved by casino staff in case of emergency may vary depending on the source and the specific casino.)
This is what Lu Le, the founder of the first reaction, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest and has stopped breathing and their heart has stopped, performing CPR will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and external chest compressions in order to have a chance to save someone.
I have found that there are still very few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it is too late. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner when faced with emergencies.
Who knows, it might still be possible to save someone's life!
First aid certifications can be registered for at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students even have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to complete before I turned 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the goal list was an event from a few months ago, but I did complete it!
Next, I plan to take other certificates I want. I am considering taking a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Only one out of 13 dumplings is a shrimp dumpling!?
Haven't tried / Never tried / Didn't try / Didn't give it a try
How come #NAME# doesn't write clearly?
"Is it 13 yuan for one?" or "It costs 13 yuan each?" (It's unclear if the question is about the price for one item or the price per item in a set.)
Yesterday, #PRS\_ORG# forgot to deliver the food, and this time it was a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I saw that the code I entered was valid before.
To begin with, I personally think that "Si Hai" is a completely terrible movie, in every sense of the word.
You may say that this movie is not a highlight, but at least the background music is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies, including those that put you to sleep in the cinema and those that fill you with righteous indignation after watching. The movie "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in countless ways for the audience.
Regarding insulting the audience, Han Han is truly unparalleled in talent.
This movie is most distressing because it seems like a deity from a sci-fi novel, hard to describe and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Little Ma's body.
You might even suspect that there is a hidden metaphor from a director after watching it, but after careful consideration, you find that it is actually just a pile of shit.
Let me simply say that there are some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male lead's place of residence should be on a certain small island in the south, where he relies on his grandmother for his life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the neighbors arranged for an uncle to take her to northeast China to see snow using his minibus.
An elderly person sits in a bread van traveling from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
And then there was no further mention of this elderly person.
The text appears to be asking how the female protagonist in a story obtained a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship. However, without more context, it is difficult to provide a precise translation. Here is one possible version:
Why can the island's flying car gangsters easily and effortlessly pave a mountain road into a dead end?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the drivers of nearby trucks couldn't be found.
This is quite obvious, isn't it? (This refers to something that is very noticeable or conspicuous)
Why would a reckless driver with a questionable background and criminal suspicions become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't they report the payday loan fraud to the police, and in the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
It's ridiculous for an adult to know how to use a smartphone, but not know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner, and sleeps outside the room for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot is prevalent throughout the entire film, and due to the plot being too absurd, I feel distressed every time I recall it.
Not only is the plot terrible, but the theme of the movie is even worse, or rather, the movie doesn't even have a theme, it's just a disgusting patchwork monster.
The beginning of the movie makes you think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes or so, you might guess it's an inspirational film. As you watch half of it, you might think it's a drama depicting the struggles of young people in small towns. But after watching the whole thing, you're left wondering what you just watched. This is followed by a deep sense of doubt, asking yourself why you even bothered to go to the cinema to watch "that" on New Year's Day.
For most people, the plot of various types of movies is actually quite familiar. For example, if you want to film a motorcycle racer, then it's inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience about how a talented rookie gradually becomes successful.
If you want to shoot a romance film, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a young man from a small town who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, the plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
For example, the character played by Yin Zheng in the new motorcycle drama, who was able to sing even after his motorcycle was burned, cannot afford to open up some "black holes" that even Kennedy couldn't handle.
As for the female lead, she sometimes acts like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects, I don't know if it's due to her acting skills or the director's requirement.
I still can't quite understand one thing - why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so passionate about adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie schedule during the Chinese New Year intended to cause inconvenience to the audience?
