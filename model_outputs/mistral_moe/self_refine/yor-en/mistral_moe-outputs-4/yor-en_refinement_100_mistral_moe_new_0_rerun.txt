Nobody knew that the dinosaurs still existed in reality until the discovery of their bones, and when they saw the shape and structure of their bones, it appeared to them as a ghost.
The researchers are still undecided if they will ever meet actual dinosaurs in the future, even if their knowledge of fossils has increased as they have examined and studied many dinosaur skeletons in the past.
It is not difficult to know that dinosaurs have existed on earth for millions of years, but they disappeared to extinction, only remaining as skeletons and fragments for research.
It is not certain whether a single dinosaur would have eaten the entire earth, if they had continued to exist, but, certainly, in the form of fossils, they continue to provide us with a wealth of scientific knowledge about the earth.

According to entomologists, it’s the barbs and barbules on the forelegs that enable these grasshoppers to easily move through dense vegetation.
Factors that allow us to identify that someone is an old dinosaur include: (1) they are not used to modern technology, and (2) they are not interested in new ways of thinking.

The scientists have assured that even if a baby dinosaur came out today, the elderly would not be able to bear it.
Farmers often say that if a child is born when a dinosaur is around, the old man does not have the strength to raise the child.

If the Rossby waves propagate as a packet, vorticity is only conserved in the mean at the baroclinic mode.
Without the Rossby waves, the equatorial atmospheric waves will not be able to propagate in the mid-latitude area, which is a part of the west wind drift zone.
