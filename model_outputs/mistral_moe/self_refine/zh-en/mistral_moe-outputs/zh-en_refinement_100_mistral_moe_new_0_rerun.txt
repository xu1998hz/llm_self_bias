Students sing the lead at Zhejiang University's academic year conference, research results open up people's minds - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, judging diseases by exhaling, accurately searching for the source of haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with wide-ranging ideas were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated an intelligent biosensor the size of half a smartphone.
"You only need to gently exhale, and this set of instruments can preliminarily detect your body health status from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone. After exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Intelligent wristbands that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes
Besides smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions this year.
Master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei of the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected early or not removed completely, which is related to the light used in the operating room of the hospital."
Shi Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot clearly see all the tumor tissues during early cancer screening, cancer cells will still spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light panels, which can adjust the spectrum to enhance the difference in the perception of different organs under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shaoyifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water and at most use a little soap and hand sanitizer, but Li Qiang and his classmates invented an "air hand washing device".
As long as you stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So, we can wash our hands clean now!
The results of the dye reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands in this way is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleaning effect and save 90% of water at the same time. The whole process is completely waste-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Major Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold award.

Okay, thank you
A certificate that is very meaningful - a first aid certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, besides my driver's license!
Let me explain: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken before an ambulance arrives in the event of a sudden event.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance. It is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency rescue.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, the window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone collapses next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than standing there motionless and unable to do anything, which is a terrifying feeling of helplessness.
In China, there are 3 million unexpected deaths every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest.
The survival rate in the United States is 15% on average.
In Las Vegas casinos, 78% of people can be saved, but it is less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first reaction from Lu Le, the founder of Zhishang.
If a person has sudden cardiac arrest and has no breathing or pulse, pinching the person in the middle of the chest will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person's life.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner when facing emergencies.
You might even save a life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I am 25 years old. Adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals is also an event that happened a few months ago, but I have indeed completed it!
Then I need to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!

13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling!?
Not tried
Why doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
It costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS\_ORG# forgot to send food, and this time it was only a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To begin with, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a completely terrible movie, in every sense of the word.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies, one that lets you fall asleep in the cinema is one type, and one that makes you feel indignant after watching is another type. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted in insulting the audience.
The most painful part of this movie is that it seems to be a creature from the Kek series, difficult to name and full of holes like the windbreaker on Little Brother.
You might even suspect that there is a hidden metaphor in it after watching it, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is actually just a pile of shit.
Let me briefly explain the plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male lead should live on a small island in the south, and he depends on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow. Then the plot was arranged for a neighbor, an old man, to drive her to northeast China to see the snow with his small van.
Elderly people sitting in a bread van from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
And then there was no further information about this old man.
How did the female owner of a hotel on an abandoned ship get a business license for her brother?
Why can the island's flying car gangsters easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere nearby.
This prop is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a reckless young man with a criminal record and poor credit become a police auxiliary?
Why don't people report high-interest loans to the police? In movies, the police even ask if there are any difficulties.
A grown-up knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then arranges to find the hotel owner to sleep outside the door for a night?
This kind of inexplicable plot is full of the whole movie, and because the plot is too absurd, I will feel painful when I recall them.
Worse than the plot is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just a hideous monster stitched together.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational movie. After watching half of it, you might think it's a drama depicting the survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you might not know what you've seen, and then you will have deep doubts, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the big toilet during the New Year.
For most people, the plots of various movies are actually quite familiar. For example, if you want to shoot a movie about a motorcycle racer, then it's inspirational + comedy, and tell the audience how a talented novice gradually becomes successful step by step.
If you want to shoot a love movie, you should honestly tell the story of the grudges between a small-town young man who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the role played by Yin Zheng in the new motorcycle that was just burned and can still sing), it is impossible to open some brain holes that even Kennedy could not bear to watch.
As for the female lead, Mingming, she is not mentally challenged, but she sometimes behaves like a 5-year-old child. I don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one thing I can't figure out, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Are these kinds of movie arrangements during the Chinese New Year for the purpose of obstructing the audience?
