Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such an incident from happening again
Or how much longer will the restaurant take to prepare? Can you ask for me?
Students take center stage at Zhejiang University's academic year conference, research findings leave people in awe - Xinhua News Agency
At the 2016 Zhejiang University Academic Conference's opening ceremony, a series of innovative academic achievements were recognized, including washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases by exhaling, and accurately identifying the origin of smog.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the College of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated an intelligent biosensor the size of half a smartphone.
"You only need to gently exhale, and this set of instruments can preliminarily detect your body health status from the components of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone. After exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Intelligent wristbands that can detect health status on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes
Besides smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Exhibition of Inventions this year.
Master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei of the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new idea in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
The light used in operating rooms can lead to inadequate detection and removal of many diseases in their early stages.
Shi Junfei said that, for example, if doctors cannot clearly see all the tumor tissues during early cancer screening, cancer cells will still spread later.
This surgical light has four light sources, which can adjust the spectrum to increase the contrast of different tissues under illumination.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shaoyifu Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using Air to Wash Hands: Water-Saving and Stylish
An ordinary person washes their hands with water and at most uses a little soap and hand sanitizer, but Li Qiang and his classmates invented a "contactless hand washing device".
As long as you stand on the scale, our weight can push the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
So, we can wash our hands thoroughly now!
The results of the dye reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effect of washing hands in this way is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only requires gravity as a driving force, which guarantees the cleaning effect and conserves 90% of water. The process is waste-free, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit on Major Challenges, this invention received the only gold award among numerous top-tier institutions.

Bones and spicy pickles are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location.
I'm not waiting anymore, cancel the order
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?

Okay, no problem.
A certificate that is very meaningful - a first aid certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, besides my driver's license!
Let me explain: first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken before an ambulance arrives in the event of a sudden event.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance. It is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time for emergency rescue.
If I truly experience a heart attack, a cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden cardiac arrest, we will have only four minutes to save our lives, the "golden four minutes."
That's why it's so important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone collapses next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, rather than standing there motionless and unable to do anything, which is a terrifying feeling of helplessness.
In China, there are approximately 3 million sudden cardiac deaths each year, making it the leading cause of death.
The survival rate in the United States is 15% on average.
In Las Vegas casinos, 78% of people can be saved, but it is less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is the first reaction from Lu Le, the founder of Zhishang.
If a person has sudden cardiac arrest and has no breathing or pulse, pinching the person in the middle of the chest will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person's life.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner when facing emergencies.
You might even save a life!
You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Chinese Red Cross Society training center. I signed up at the Zhuhai branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and students are eligible for discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself to achieve before turning 25. I included getting a first aid certificate among these goals a few months ago, and I am happy to report that I have indeed achieved this goal!
Then I need to take other certificates I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that I need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I have ordered #NUMBER#
13 yuan for only one shrimp dumpling!?
Not tried
Why doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
It costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS\_ORG# forgot to send food, and this time it was only a shrimp dumpling for me to eat!?
Because I saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
I will start by saying that I personally think "Four Seas" is a complete failure in every sense.
But if you say that this movie is not a highlight, at least the music selection is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies, one that lets you fall asleep in the cinema is one type, and one that makes you feel indignant after watching is another type. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Emei Mountain, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Regarding insulting the audience, Han Han is truly unparalleled in his talent.
The most painful part of this movie is that it seems to be a creature from the Kek series, difficult to name and full of holes like the windbreaker on Little Brother.
You might even suspect that there is a hidden metaphor in it after watching it, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is actually just a pile of shit.
Let me briefly explain the parts of the story that I find hard to understand.
The protagonist should reside on a small island in the southern region, and he is closely attached to his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow. Then the plot was arranged for a neighbor, an old man, to drive her to northeast China to see the snow with his small van.
Elderly people traveling in a minibus from the south to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
The old man was never mentioned again.
How did the female owner of a hotel on an abandoned ship get a business license for her brother?
Why can the island's car gang members easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped on the side of the road, and the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere nearby.
This prop is too conspicuous, isn't it?
Why would a young man with a history of illegal activities and a poor credit rating become a community safety officer?
Why don't people report high-interest loans to the police? In movies, the police even ask if there are any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to open the door with a room key in a hotel, and then waits outside the room for the hotel owner to come back?
This kind of plot, which is difficult to understand, is filled throughout the movie, and because the plot is too absurd, I feel pain when I recall it.
Worse than the plot is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, it's just a hideous monster stitched together.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational movie. After watching half of it, you might think it's a drama depicting the survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you might not know what you've seen, and then you will have deep doubts, why did you go to the cinema to enjoy the big toilet during the New Year.
Most people are quite familiar with the cliches in movies. For instance, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, it's an inspirational story with a comedic undertone that shows how a rookie with talent gradually becomes successful.
If you want to make a romance film, you should tell the sincere story of the misunderstandings between a young man from the countryside who enjoys riding motorcycles and a female service worker.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the role played by Yin Zheng in the new motorcycle that was just burned and can still sing), it is impossible to open some brain holes that even Kennedy could not bear to watch.
As for the female lead, Mingming, she is not intellectually disabled, but she sometimes behaves like a 5-year-old. I don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's request.
There is one thing I can't quite understand, why is Han Han, as a racecar driver, so enthusiastic about adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Are these kinds of movie arrangements during Spring Festival intended to inconvenience the audience?
