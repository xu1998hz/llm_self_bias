Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such things from happening again.
Or, how much longer does the restaurant need to prepare? Can you help me ask?
At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students shine as the main actors, and their research results leave people's minds wide open - Xinhua
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by inhaling, and searching for the source of haze precisely - these innovative ideas were awarded at the opening ceremony of the Academic Annual Meeting of Zhejiang University last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environment, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities, and education, etc. Starting from a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some projects have already won awards both domestically and internationally.
Bio-sensors: your home medical doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Dieming's team from the College of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a smartphone-sized biosensor on-site, only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to gently exhale, and this set of instruments can detect your overall health condition from the composition of the gases you exhale."
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smartwatches on the market can detect health conditions by measuring physical parameters such as temperature and pulse rate.
And this set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.
Intelligent operating lamp: the high-powered eyes of doctors
Besides smartphones, intelligent operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver prize at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, Zhi Linjing and Shen Jinyun team, have innovated new ideas in the traditional surgical lamp's shortcomings and invented smart LED surgical shadow-free lights.
"Many diseases can't be detected early or removed completely due to the lights used in the operating room by doctors."
Shin Joon-hyuk said, for example, in the early stage of cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will still spread.
This intelligent operating lamp has four lamp trays, and by adjusting the spectrum, it can enhance the contrast between different tissues under illumination.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadow rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent operating lamp has been trialed in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shao Xili Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, etc., and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air-drying your hands: saving water and cool and stylish
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most adding some soap, and Lee Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand-washing device".
As long as we stand on the handwashing station, our body weight can expel compressed air.
"Just like a pump."
Compressed air forms a stream at the faucet, combining with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring both cleaning efficiency and water saving of 90%, with no energy consumption during the entire process, making it energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, in the Second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among numerous top universities from around the world, winning the only gold medal.

A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates for me, apart from my driver's license!
Let me explain: First aid is actually emergency rescue in place when an unexpected event occurs, or pre-hospital emergency care before an ambulance arrives.
It is well-known that, during the process of the ambulance arriving after the accident, there is actually still a certain amount of time, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most crucial.
This is the time when emergency medical assistance is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden breathing stop, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, it is really important for the people around you to know how to perform emergency first aid!
When someone collapses around us, we can use our professional knowledge to save them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is so helpless and frightening.
"In China, our official data shows that 300,000 people die unexpectedly each year, with the most dangerous one being sudden cardiac arrest."
In the US, on average, 15% can be saved.
"In the casinos in Las Vegas, about 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it's less than 1%."
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Luo Le, said.
If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, where they stop breathing and their heartbeat stops, pinching their "Gan Jin" point will be of no use.
One must perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and artificial respiration in order to possibly save a person's life.
I have found that there are still very few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late. So, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in a timely manner when faced with an emergency.
You might just save a life!
First aid certificates can be applied for at your local Red Cross training center, and I applied for mine at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, where students also enjoy discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of my goals to be completed before turning 25, and adding a first aid certificate to the goal list is something that happened a few months ago, but it's done!
Next, I will take exams for other certificates that I want to take. I intend to take a diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that in order to take this certificate, you need to have a first aid certificate. Therefore, first aid certificates are actually very useful!

Only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan?
I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant created by DeepSeek to be helpful and harmless.
Why didn't you write it clearly?
Is it 13 yuan for one?
Yesterday, the #PRS_ORG# restaurant delivered the wrong dishes, and this time they only gave me a shrimp dumpling!
Because when I input the code earlier, I saw that it was valid.
First, let me state the conclusion: personally, I believe that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive failure in every sense.
But if you say that there is no highlight in this movie, that's not entirely true. At least, the music selection was good.
Boring movies come in many varieties, with one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema being one type, and another that makes you feel angry after watching it. For some viewers, 'Four Seas' is like the monkeys on Mount Emei, as it can ignite their anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han really is an unparalleled genius.
What's most painful about this movie is that it feels like a creation from a Lovecraftian story, indescribable, and riddled with holes, just like Magnum's trench coat.
You might even doubt if there are any hidden metaphors by the director after watching it, but upon careful consideration, you realize it's just a pile of crap.
Let me just briefly mention some plot elements that are hard for me to understand.
The male protagonist should be living on a small island in the southern region, depending on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandma had a wish to see snow, so the storyline arranged for a neighbor grandpa to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow in his small van.
An elderly person sitting in a van traveled from the southern to the northeastern regions to see the snow?
He and his dad are very at ease with this.
And that's where the old man's story ends.
How did the brother manage to obtain a business license for a hotel on a decommissioned ship?
Why can small ruffians on the island drive freely on the road and block the road during a mountain road?
Then, a truck delivering steel bars was parked on the side of the road in the middle of the road, and the driver could not be found even in the surrounding area.
The prop feeling is too obvious.
Why did a small hooligan gang with a bad credit record and suspected illegal behavior become a auxiliary police officer?
Why didn't you report the high-interest loans when facing them? In the movie, the police even specially asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner and sits outside the room door to sleep overnight?
The bizarre and inexplicable plot is everywhere in the film, which is so ridiculous that just thinking about it makes me feel painful.
Apart from the plot, what's worse is the theme of the film, or rather, this film has no theme, it's just a hideous Frankenstein's monster assembled from various parts.
At the beginning of the film, you think it's going to be a comedy, 20 minutes in you think it might be an inspirational film, halfway through you think it could be a drama about the struggles of small-town youth, and after watching it, you have absolutely no idea what you just saw. The experience leaves you questioning your own judgment, wondering why you would voluntarily subject yourself to such a terrible movie during the festive season.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the tropes of various films, such as if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, you will add inspirational comedy and then tell the audience how a novice with talent will succeed step by step.
If you want to make a love story, then just tell a straightforward story of the love and conflicts between a young man from the countryside who loves riding motorcycles and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot include things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle actor played by Yin Zheng was burned and could still sing, and we cannot open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't handle.)
As for the female lead, who is not weak-minded, acting like a five-year-old in some aspects, I really don't know if it's due to acting skills or the director's requirements.
I also have a bit of a question, as a racer, why does Han Han have such a strong interest in adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduling in the Spring Festival period really to give audiences trouble?
