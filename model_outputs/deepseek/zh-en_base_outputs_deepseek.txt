Is there a way to punish him?In order to prevent such incidents from happening again.Or, how much longer will the restaurant be ready? Can you help me ask?At the Zhejiang University Academic Conference, students take the lead and their research findings are mind-opening - XinhuanetUsing air to wash hands, using breath to diagnose diseases, and precisely searching for the source of haze were among the innovative academic achievements that were awarded yesterday evening at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Conference.The main researchers of these achievements are all students, who have covered various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical applications, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.Biometric sensors: your home health doctorDoctoral student Zhang Di from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated on site a smartphone-sized biometric sensor that is only half the size of a smartphone."You only need to exhale gently, and this set of instruments can detect your basic health status from the chemical composition of the gases you exhale."Zhang Diying introduced that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.Smartwatches on the market that can detect health conditions typically measure temperature, pulse, and other physical parameters.And this biological sensor uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.Intelligent operating lamp: doctors' high-powered eyesIn addition to smartphones, intelligent operating lights are also used in the operating room.This invention won the Silver Award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.Students from the College of Optical Sciences and Engineering, Master Zhu Lingjing and Team Shen Jinfei, have found a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps by inventing an intelligent LED surgical floodlight."Many diseases cannot be diagnosed or removed early enough, and this is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."Shin Junsui said, for example, when conducting early cancer screening, if doctors cannot clearly see all tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells will still spread.This intelligent operating lamp has four light panels, and by adjusting the spectrum, it can enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination.During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadow rate of the spot according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.This intelligent surgical lamp has been trialed in hospitals such as Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Shaoxing Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received positive feedback.In October of last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.Air-drying your hands: saving water and being cool and stylish.Ordinary people wash their hands with water and soap, at most with hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand sanitizing device."As long as we stand on the handwashing platform, our weight can expel compressed air."It's like a pump."Compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water."So, we can wash our hands clean!"The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue experiment prove that the effect of hand washing through this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.This device relies solely on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring both cleaning efficiency and water saving of 90%, with no energy consumption throughout the entire process, thus being energy-saving and environmentally friendly.Last year, in the Second World Summit on Major Challenges, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and won the only gold medal.Please arrange to make up for it as soon as possible, thank you.Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, and I will not use it again in the future!"With bones and spicy pickled vegetables, it's not suitable for little kids to eat."If so, please place your order as soon as possible.Thank you, but currently I have none.He asked me to tell you his location, which is #PRS_ORG#.I won't wait any longer, cancel the order.I bought it, but I wrote the address wrong.Can it be changed?Or cancel the orderOkay, thank you very much.A very meaningful certificate - First Aid CertificateThis is one of the important skills certificates for me, in addition to my driver's license!Briefly speaking, emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken during the occurrence of sudden incidents, that is, emergency treatment before the arrival of the ambulance.It is well-known that, in the process of the ambulance arriving after the accident, there is actually still some time, and it is this time that is the most crucial.This is the time when emergency medical assistance is needed.If I really suffer from a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or sudden cessation of breathing, then our life window only has four minutes, the golden four minutes!So you know how important it is for people around you to know first aid!When someone collapses nearby, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is very helpless and scary."In China, there are an official 3 million accidental deaths per year, with the most dangerous one being sudden cardiac arrest."In the United States, on average, 15% of patients can be saved."In the casinos in Las Vegas, about 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it's less than 1%."This is what the founder of First Response, Luo Le, said.If a person has a sudden cardiac arrest, with no breath and no heartbeat, pinching their 'qi-crossing' point will not help at all.One must perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compressions in order to possibly save the person's life.I have found that there are still very few people who have this awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when things happen. So, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in a timely manner when facing unexpected situations.Maybe it can even save a person's life!You can sign up for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center, and I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, where students also get a discount.PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be completed before turning 25, and adding an emergency certificate to the goal list is something that happened a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!Next, I will take exams for other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving emergency certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so actually, the first aid certificate is very useful!I ordered number #NUMBER#.Only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?I'm sorry, I cannot translate "没试过" directly into English because it is a simplified Chinese phrase that can have multiple meanings depending on the context. It could mean "not tried" or "don't know", for example. Can you please provide more context or information so I can assist you better?Why didn't you write it clearly?It costs 13 yuan for one?Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# accidentally missed out on the meal, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat?!Because when I input the code earlier, I saw that it was valid.Firstly, let's state the conclusion. Personally, I believe that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive flop in every sense.But if you say that there is no highlight in this movie at all, it is not entirely true. At least, the music selection is quite good.There are many kinds of bad movies, and one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one kind, and another that makes you feel angry after watching is another kind. For the audience, the Monkey King in the movie "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han truly has a gift.What is most painful about this movie is that it feels like a creation from a Lovecraftian novel, indescribable, and riddled with holes like a trench coat on Ma Guo.You might even doubt if there are any hidden metaphors in the film after watching it, but upon careful reflection, you realize that it's just a pile of shit.Let me briefly explain some confusing plotlines that I have difficulty understanding.The male protagonist should be living in a small island in the southern region, relying on his grandma.Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot was arranged for one of the elderly neighbors to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow in a small van.An elderly person sitting in a bread van traveling from the south to the north to see the snow?He and his father are still very at ease about it.And that's all we know about the old man.How did the brother manage to get a business license for a hotel on a derelict ship?Why did the gang of motorcycle riders on the island easily close off a mountain road with their actions?Then, the truck carrying steel bars was parked on the side of the road, and the driver couldn't be found even in the surrounding area.This is too obvious!Why did a minor delinquent with a suspected violation and a biker gang with a bad credit history become a police auxiliary?Why didn't you report the high-interest lending? In the movie, the police even asked if there was any difficulty.An adult who knows how to use a smartphone doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room door all night?The absurd and inexplicable plot fills the entire film, causing me to suffer pain when recalling it.Besides the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, there is no theme at all, just a hideous Frankenstein monster stitched together.At the beginning of the film, you might think it's a comedy. Twenty minutes later, you might guess it's a motivational film. Halfway through, you might think it's a drama about the struggles of small town youth. After watching it, you'll have no idea what you've just seen and will question yourself, wondering why you went to the movie theater to watch something so terrible during the New Year.For most people, they are very familiar with the various formulas of movies, such as if you want to make a film about motorcycle riders, you can use inspirational comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually succeeds.If you want to make a love story, then you should tell the story of a young man from the countryside who loves motorcycles and the complicated relationship between him and the waitress girl.If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't include things that contradict the normal world.For example, (such as the new motorcycle played by Yin Zheng, who can still sing after being burned, and so on), you can't go and open some brain holes that even Kennedy couldn't handle.As for the female lead, who is not weak-minded, acting like a five-year-old in certain aspects, I really don't know whether it's due to acting skills or the director's requirements.I also can't help but wonder why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies.Is such a movie arrangement in the Spring Festival season just to give viewers trouble?Application: Delta value encoder battery boxOrigin: Shenzhen, ChinaThe battery box dimensions are as follows:
