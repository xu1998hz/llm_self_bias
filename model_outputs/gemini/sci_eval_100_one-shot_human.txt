- \\(T\\) is the temperature (in Kelvin)
- \\(n\\) is the number of components in the mixture
- \\(x_i\\) is the mole fraction of component \\(i\\)

$$\\x_{H_2} = \frac{3.0 \text{ mol}}{5.0 \text{ mol}} = 0.60$$

- The equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction at different temperatures is given in the table.

ln K = -ΔH°rxn / (R × T)
where ΔH°rxn is the standard reaction enthalpy, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

- By plotting ln K versus 1/T, the slope of the line is equal to -ΔH°rxn / R.

- Using the data provided, the slope of the plot was calculated to be -6.4 × 10^3 K.

- Substituting the slope and R into the equation above, we get:
ΔH°rxn = (-6.4 × 10^3 K) × (8.314 J/mol·K) = 5.3 × 10^4 J/mol

- Finally, converting the result to kilojoules per mole, we have:
ΔH°rxn = 5.3 × 10^4 J/mol ÷ 1000 = 53 kJ/mol

 "rationale": "The answer is correct.

 The standard enthalpy of formation of a compound is the change in enthalpy that accompanies the formation of one mole of the compound from its constituent elements in their standard states. At 298 K, the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) is -241.82 kJ/mol. This means that when one mole of H2(g) and one-half mole of O2(g) react to form one mole of H2O(g), 241.82 kJ of heat is released.

The molar heat capacity at constant pressure is the amount of heat that must be absorbed by one mole of a substance to raise its temperature by 1 K at constant pressure. The molar heat capacities of H2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) are given in the question.

The change in enthalpy of a reaction can be calculated using the following equation:

```
\Delta H = \Delta H^{\circ} + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_P^{\circ} dT
```

where:

* \Delta H is the change in enthalpy of the reaction
* \Delta H^{\circ} is the standard enthalpy of the reaction
* \Delta C_P^{\circ} is the change in the molar heat capacity at constant pressure
* T_1 is the initial temperature
* T_2 is the final temperature

In this case, we are interested in calculating the change in enthalpy of the reaction:

```
H_2(g) + \frac{1}{2}O_2(g) -> H_2O(g)
```

at 100\(^o\)C (373 K). We know that the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) at 298 K is -241.82 kJ/mol and the molar heat capacities of H2(g), O2(g), and H2O(g) are given in the question.

To calculate the change in enthalpy of the reaction at 100\(^o\)C, we can use the following equation:

```
\Delta H = \Delta H^{\circ} + \int_{298}^{373} \Delta C_P^{\circ} dT
```

where:

* \Delta H is the change in enthalpy of the reaction at 100\(^o\)C
* \Delta H^{\circ} is the standard enthalpy of formation of H2O(g) at 298 K
* \Delta C_P^{\circ} is the change in the molar heat capacity at constant pressure
* T_1 is 298 K
* T_2 is 373 K

The change in the molar heat capacity at constant pressure can be calculated as follows:

```
\Delta C_P^{\circ} = C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{g}) - \frac{1}{2}C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{H}_2, \mathrm{g}) - \frac{1}{2}C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{O}_2, \mathrm{g})
```

where:

* C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{g}) is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of H2O(g)
* C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{H}_2, \mathrm{g}) is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of H2(g)
* C_P^{\circ}(\mathrm{O}_2, \mathrm{g}) is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure of O2(g)

Substituting the values of the molar heat capacities into the equation, we get:

```
\Delta C_P^{\circ} = 33.58 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} - \frac{1}{2}(28.82 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}) - \frac{1}{2}(29.36 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})
```

```
\Delta C_P^{\circ} = -24.98 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}

Substituting the values of \Delta H^{\circ}, \Delta C_P^{\circ}, T_1, and T_2 into the equation, we get:

```
$$v_f=v_e \ln \frac{m_i}{m_f}$$
```
where:
 - \(v_f\) is the final velocity of the rocket
 - \(v_e\) is the effective exhaust velocity
 - \(m_i\) is the initial mass of the rocket
 - \(m_f\) is the final mass of the rocket

The given data are:
 - \(m_i=2.8 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}\)
 - \(m_f=2.8 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}+2.1 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}\)
 - \(v_e=2600 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\)

 First, calculate the burn time \(t_0\): 
```
$$ t_0= \frac{m_i}{\dot{m}}= \frac{2.8 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}+2.1 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}}{37 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~N} / 2600 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}=3.036 \mathrm{~s}$$
```
Then, calculate the final velocity \(v_f\):
```
$$ v_f=2600 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \ln \left[\frac{2.8 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}+2.1 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}}{2.8 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~kg}}\right]=2600 \ln 2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=2669.8968331873774 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$$

Therefore, the final speed of the first stage at burnout is \(2669.8968331873774 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\). Note that the answer should be given to 4 significant figures, which is 2670 m/s."

 - The solution begins by defining the given parameters like the initial and final temperature/pressure along with the ideal gas constant (\(\mathcal{R}\)).
 - In the equation, the temperature-dependent specific heat capacity \(C_{P, m}\) of \(\mathrm{CO}_2\) is incorporated, which accounts for the variation of heat capacity with temperature.
 - The integral (\(\int_{T_i}^{T_f} C_{P, m} \mathrm{dT}\)) is calculated to determine the entropy change due to temperature variation.
 - Additionally, the entropy change due to pressure variation \(-\mathcal{R} \ln \frac{P_f}{P_i}\) is calculated.
 - The solution meticulously substitutes the values, evaluates the integrals, and arrives at the final result: \(\Delta S = 52.2 \mathrm{~J/K}\).

  "rationale": "Explanation:\
The rationale provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the binomial distribution formula and its application to the given coin tossing scenario. It correctly states that the probability of obtaining 25 heads (success) in 50 coin tosses (experiments) is determined by the binomial probability distribution formula. The binomial formula is derived from the concept of combinations, which calculates the number of possible ways to select k successes (heads) in n independent trials (coin tosses). The factors p and q represent the probabilities of success (heads) and failure (tails), respectively, in each trial.

The formula is structured as follows:
- n is the total number of trials, in this case, 50 coin tosses.
- k is the number of successes (heads) we are interested in calculating the probability, which is 25 in this case.
- \(\binom{n}{k}\) represents the number of ways k heads can be obtained in 50 coin tosses, calculated using combinations.
- \(p^k\) is the probability of obtaining k heads in a single trial, which is (1/2)^25 since the probability of heads is 1/2.
- \((1-p)^{n-k}\) is the probability of obtaining n-k tails in a single trial, which is (1/2)^25 since the probability of tails is also 1/2.

The rationale correctly uses the binomial probability distribution formula to calculate the probability of observing 25 heads (successes) in 50 independent coin tosses, resulting in a probability of 0.0796. The explanation is clear, precise, and accurate in its application of the binomial distribution."
