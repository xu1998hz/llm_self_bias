The problem can be solved by the following steps:

1. Find the spring constant.
2. Find the equation of motion.
3. Solve the equation of motion to get the position of the mass at any later time.
4. Find the amplitude of the motion.

Step 1: Find the spring constant

The spring constant is given by:

$$k = \frac{mg}{x}$$

where:

* m is the mass of the object (10 lb)
* g is the acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/s^2)
* x is the displacement of the object (2 in)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$k = \frac{(10 \mathrm{lb})(32 \mathrm{ft/s^2})}{2 \mathrm{in}} = 160 \mathrm{lb/in}$$

Step 2: Find the equation of motion

The equation of motion for a mass on a spring is given by:

$$m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + kx = 0$$

where:

* m is the mass of the object (10 lb)
* k is the spring constant (160 lb/in)
* x is the displacement of the object (in)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$10 \mathrm{lb}\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 160 \mathrm{lb/in}x = 0$$

Step 3: Solve the equation of motion to get the position of the mass at any later time

The solution to the equation of motion is given by:

$$x(t) = C_1 \cos(\omega t) + C_2 \sin(\omega t)$$

where:

* C_1 and C_2 are constants that depend on the initial conditions
* \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) is the angular frequency

To find the values of C_1 and C_2, we use the initial conditions:

* At t = 0, the mass is displaced an additional 2 in., so x(0) = 2 in.
* At t = 0, the mass has an initial upward velocity of 1 ft/s, so x'(0) = 1 ft/s.

Substituting these values into the equation for x(t), we get:

$$2 \mathrm{in} = C_1 \cos(0) + C_2 \sin(0)$$

$$1 \mathrm{ft/s} = -C_1 \omega \sin(0) + C_2 \omega \cos(0)$$

Solving for C_1 and C_2, we get:

$$C_1 = 2 \mathrm{in}$$

$$C_2 = \frac{1 \mathrm{ft/s}}{\omega}$$

Substituting these values into the equation for x(t), we get:

$$x(t) = 2 \mathrm{in} \cos(\omega t) + \frac{1 \mathrm{ft/s}}{\omega} \sin(\omega t)$$

Step 4: Find the amplitude of the motion

The amplitude of the motion is given by:

$$A = \sqrt{C_1^2 + C_2^2}$$

Substituting the values of C_1 and C_2 that we found, we get:



$$A = \sqrt{(2 \mathrm{in})^2 + \left(\frac{1 \mathrm{ft/s}}{\omega}\right)^2 }$$

$$A = \sqrt{(2 \mathrm{in})^2 + \left(\frac{1 \mathrm{ft/s}}{\sqrt{\frac{160 \mathrm{lb/in}}{10 \mathrm{lb}}}}\right)^2}$$

$$A = \sqrt{(2 \mathrm{in})^2 + (0.25 \mathrm{in})^2}$$

$$A = 2.06 \mathrm{in}$$

- 'The work done by the shipper is equal to the negative of the change in the kinetic energy of the cabbage heads'.

mgh = 1/2 mv^2

1. The perfect gas equation is:
$$PV = nRT$$

* P is the pressure in pascals (Pa)
* V is the volume in cubic meters (m^3)
* n is the number of moles of gas (mol)
* R is the ideal gas constant ($8.31 \mathrm{~J \cdot mol^{-1} \cdot K^{-1} }$)
* T is the temperature in Kelvin (K)

2. The number of moles of gas can be calculated using the following equation:
$$n = \frac{m}{M}$$
Where:
* m is the mass of the gas in grams (g)
* M is the molar mass of the gas in grams per mole (g/mol)

3. The molar mass of nitrogen gas is $28.01 \mathrm{~g \cdot mol^{-1}}$.

4. Substitute the given values into the equations above:
$$n = \frac{1.25 \mathrm{~g}}{28.01 \mathrm{~g \cdot mol^{-1}}} = 0.0446 \mathrm{~mol}$$
$$PV = nRT$$
$$P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{(0.0446 \mathrm{~mol})(0.0821 \mathrm{~L \cdot atm \cdot mol^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}})(293 \mathrm{~K})}{0.250 \mathrm{~L}} = 116 \mathrm{kPa}$$

5. Convert the pressure from kilopascals to pascals:
$$116 \mathrm{kPa} = 116 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~Pa} = \boxed{116000 \mathrm{~Pa}}$$

6. Therefore, the pressure exerted by $1.25 \mathrm{~g}$ of nitrogen gas in a flask of volume $250 \mathrm{~cm}^3$ at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $116 \mathrm{kPa}$ or $116000 \mathrm{~Pa}$.

  "correctness": "True",
  "rationale": "The rationale is correct. The problem asks to calculate the standard reduction potential ($E\degree$) for the half-cell reaction Fe3+(aq) + 3 e- -> Fe(s).

  The given reduction reactions and their corresponding standard reduction potentials ($E\degree$) are:

  - Fe3+(aq) + e- -> Fe2+(aq): $E\degree$ = +0.771 V
  - Fe2+(aq) + 2 e- -> Fe(s): $E\degree$ = -0.447 V

  To calculate the standard reduction potential for the desired half-cell reaction, we can use the following equation:

  $E\degree$ (overall) = $E\degree$ (reduction 1) + $E\degree$ (reduction 2)

  Substituting the given values, we get:

  $E\degree$ (Fe3+(aq) + 3 e- -> Fe(s)) = $E\degree$ (Fe3+(aq) + e- -> Fe2+(aq)) + $E\degree$ (Fe2+(aq) + 2 e- -> Fe(s))

  $E\degree$ (Fe3+(aq) + 3 e- -> Fe(s)) = (+0.771 V) + (-0.447 V)

  $E\degree$ (Fe3+(aq) + 3 e- -> Fe(s)) = +0.324 V

  Therefore, the standard reduction potential for the half-cell reaction Fe3+(aq) + 3 e- -> Fe(s) is +0.324 V.

  The answer provided in the evaluation matches the calculated value, confirming its correctness."

  "rationale": "The answer is correct. The equilibrium pressure between graphite and diamond can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The equation is stated as $$\mathrm{dP}=\bar{V}_m(-\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ} / \mathrm{d} T),$$ where $\bar{V}_m$ is the molar volume and $\Delta G_f^{\circ}$ is the standard free energy of formation. The difference of $\Delta G_f^{\circ}$ for graphite and diamond can be written as $$\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ}=-\Delta G_f^{\circ}(\mathrm{C}, \text { graphite })+\Delta G_f^{\circ}(\mathrm{C}, \text { diamond })$$ Given that the molar volume is given by $$\bar{V}_m=M/\rho$$ where $M$ is the molar mass and $\rho$ is the density. Substituting the molar volume into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we obtain $$\mathrm{dP}=(-\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ} / \mathrm{d} T)(M/\rho)$$ The term $\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ} / \mathrm{d} T$ can be calculated using the following equation $$\frac{\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ}}{\mathrm{d} T}=-\Delta S_f^{\circ}$$ where $\Delta S_f^{\circ}$ is the standard entropy of formation. The standard entropies of formation for graphite and diamond can be obtained from a reference book. Then we can calculate the $\mathrm{d} \Delta G_f^{\circ} / \mathrm{d} T$. Substituting all the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we can calculate the equilibrium pressure. The final answer is 13510.3462474 bar, which is consistent with the given answer.
