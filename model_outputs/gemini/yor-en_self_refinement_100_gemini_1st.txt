It wasn't the smallest dinosaur, but it does provide a glimpse into the debate about dinosaur colors and feathers.
Scientists say the animal's fur is chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
That also gives the story of the lives of birds in the forest.
Because a feather rachis is not a solid rod, like a quill, but has other feather parts—barbs and barbules—attached to it, some researchers have suggested that the rachis may be an evolutionary predecessor to the quill.
It is believed that feathers were not used for flight in early dinosaurs, but for insulation or display. Evidence suggests that even if they were a type of primitive feather, their structure was more like modern feathers.
According to the researchers, if the meat is from a dinosaur species, its texture is more like that of an adult dinosaur than a juvenile dinosaur.
