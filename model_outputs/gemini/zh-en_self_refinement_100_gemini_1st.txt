Students take center stage at Zhejiang University's academic annual conference, research findings spark wild imaginations-Xinhua News Agency
Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of highly original academic achievements were recognized. These included:* A new method for washing hands using air instead of water.* A technique for diagnosing diseases by analyzing a person's breath.* A system for accurately identifying the sources of haze pollution.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, humanities and education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Health Physician
A team of doctoral students led by Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a smartphone-based biosensor on-site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"With just a light breath, this device can perform a preliminary analysis of your health status based on the composition of your exhaled breath."
Zhang Diming explained that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling into it, a health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses the new material graphene, which targets chemical compounds. Its keen "sensitivity" allows it to reflect the state of the body's health more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamp: the doctor's high-tech eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, found a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected or removed early because of the lights used in the operating room."
For example, Shen Junfei said, if the doctor cannot see all the cancerous tissue in time during an early cancer examination, the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless ratio at any time according to the needs of the surgery and their personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Shaoxing Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.Feedback:'Shaoxing' is a critical accuracy/mistranslation errorImproved translation:This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
洗手不用水：既省水又酷炫
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most they wipe some soap or squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's platform, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a pump.
Compressed air forms a fluid that mixes with water at the tap.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only relies on gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of washing and save 90% of water. The whole process is energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - emergency first aid certificate
This is one of the skill certificates I feel is important besides a driver's license!
First aid is emergency treatment given to an injured or ill person before professional medical help arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and this period of time is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window of my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
 ```So it is very important for people around you to know how to give first aid!```
When someone collapses beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to save him instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too awful.
In China, according to official data, approximately 3 million people die from sudden cardiac arrest each year, making it the leading cause of accidental death.
In the United States, the national average survival rate is 15%.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80 percent can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
That's according to First Reaction founder Lu Le.
如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸停止，心跳停止，掐人中是没有任何作用的。
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to save a person's life.
I have noticed that very few of us have the awareness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it is too late. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill so that we can react promptly when faced with emergencies.
Maybe even save a life!
You can sign up for a first aid training course at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, where students can get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Next, I'm going to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certification. I saw a scuba diving emergency first aid certification on Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certification to take this certification, so in fact, the first aid certification is still very useful!

First, let me state my conclusion: I personally think "The Four Seas" is a bad film in every sense of the word.
But it's not like the movie doesn't have any bright spots. At least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies. Some can make you fall asleep in the cinema, while others make you feel indignant after watching them. "Si Hai" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.Feedback:'"One Second"' is a critical accuracy/mistranslation error'峨眉山' is a major accuracy/mistranslation errorPlease fix above error. You can rewrite translation if translation is bad. Improved translation:There are many kinds of bad movies.

It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted in insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be an indescribable creation, full of loopholes.
[BLOCKED]
Let me first briefly mention some plots that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, living with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in his small van.
老年人乘面包车从南方到东北看雪？
He and his father were still very confident about this.
Then the old man was gone.
How did the heroine's brother get a business license to open a hotel on a cruise ship?
Why can the island's motorcycle gang easily block a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped by the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a petty criminal with a poor credit history become a police officer?
Why not call the police when facing loan sharks? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any threats or coercion.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door of a hotel, then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room for a night?
These inexplicable plots are all over the film, and the plots are so outrageous that I feel pain when I recall them.
除了情节外，更糟糕的是电影的主旨，或者说这电影根本没有主旨，就是一个面目可憎的缝合怪。Worse than the plot is the film's theme, or rather the film has no theme at all, it's just a poorly stitched-together monster.

For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then inspire + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually becomes successful.
If you want to shoot a love story, then you should honestly tell the story of the love and conflict between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and a female clerk.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was just burned, and then he can still sing a role), he can't just open up some wild ideas that even Kennedy couldn't handle.
[BLOCKED]
There is one more thing I don't quite understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is such a movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to annoy the audience?
