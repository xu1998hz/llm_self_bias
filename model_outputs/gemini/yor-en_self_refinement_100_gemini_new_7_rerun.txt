Certainly, it wasn't the smallest dinosaur, that much is certain. However, this discovery offers an extraordinary glimpse into the ongoing scientific debate about dinosaur colors, such as whether or not they had feathers.
Scientists report that the animal's coat is chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
It also gives the story of the lives of the birds in the forest.
Since a feather rachis has other feather parts attached to it, such as barbs and barbules, unlike the solid rod quill, researchers suggest that the rachis might predate the quill evolutionarily.
It is believed that feathers were not used for flight in early dinosaurs, but for insulation or display. Evidence suggests that even if they were a type of primitive feather, their structure was similar to modern down feathers.
According to the researchers, if the meat belongs to a dinosaur species, its texture is similar to that of an adult dinosaur, not that of a juvenile dinosaur.
