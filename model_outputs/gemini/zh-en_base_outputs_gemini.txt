Students take center stage at Zhejiang University's academic annual conference, research findings spark wild imaginations-Xinhua News Agency
Wash hands with air, judge diseases by breath, accurately search for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of academic achievements with great originality were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical treatment, life science, humanities and education. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of the projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Health Care Physician
Zhang Diming's team of doctoral students from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a biosensor for smartphones on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to take a light breath, and this instrument can detect your health status from the composition of your exhaled gas."
This sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, a health report will be displayed on the phone, Zhang Diming introduced.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses the new material graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the state of the body's health more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical lamp: the doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, started with the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED shadowless surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected or removed early because of the lights used in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, when checking for early cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadowless rate at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Shaoxing Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, the invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most they wipe some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, but Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap and combines with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean! "
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of washing and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.

A certificate that I think is very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skill certificates I feel is important besides a driver's license!
Popularize: First aid is actually emergency rescue when a sudden incident occurs, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of the ambulance coming after the accident, and this period of time is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is very important for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down beside us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too terrible.
"In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die of accidents every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the national average is 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80 percent can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
That's according to First Reaction founder Lu Le.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, no heartbeat, pinching the person's philtrum is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to save a person's life.
I found that very few of us have the consciousness to learn first aid now, but when something happens, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe even save a life!
You can sign up for first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Next, I'm going to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving first aid certificate on Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER##
13 yuan for one shrimp dumpling!?
Never tried
Why doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed a meal, this time I only got a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before
Let's talk about the conclusion first. I personally think "The Four Seas" is a bad film in all aspects.
But if you want to say that this movie doesn't have any bright spots, that's not true. At least the soundtrack is pretty good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one kind is the kind that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and another kind is the kind that makes you feel indignant after watching it. "One Second" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is really gifted in insulting the audience.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in the Cthulhu mythos, indescribable, with as many loopholes as the windbreaker on Xiao Ma.
[BLOCKED]
Let me first briefly mention some plots that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, depending on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast to see the snow in a small van.
Elderly people take a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow? ?
He and his father were still very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
How did the heroine's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the little gangsters on the island easily block a section of mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars in the middle of the road stopped by the roadside, and the truck driver could not be found anywhere.
This prop is too obvious.
Why would a delinquent motorcycle gang member with a bad credit history and suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not call the police when facing usury? In the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door of a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner and sleeps outside the room for a night?
These inexplicable plots are all over the film, and the plots are so outrageous that it pains me to recall them.
Worse than the plot is the film's theme, or rather the film has no theme at all, it's just an ugly stitched monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think he wanted to make a comedy. After 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel that it might be a feature film that wants to reflect the difficult life of young people in small towns. After watching it, you don't even know what you watched. Then you doubt yourself deeply. Why did you go to the cinema to watch shit during the Spring Festival?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then inspire + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually becomes successful.
If you want to shoot a love story, then you should honestly tell the story of the love-hate relationship between a young man in a small town who likes to ride a motorcycle and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was just burned, and then he can still sing a role), he can't just open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand.
[BLOCKED]
There is one more thing I don't quite understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is such a movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to annoy the audience?
