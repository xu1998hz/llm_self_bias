The probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box of length $a$ is found between 0 and $a / 2$ is given by the integral of the probability density $|\psi|^2$ over the interval $[0, a / 2]$:
$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \int_{0}^{\frac{a}{2}} |\psi|^2 \mathrm{d} x
$$

For a particle in a one-dimensional box, the probability density is given by:

$$
|\psi|^2 = \frac{4}{a^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{n \pi x}{a}\right)
$$

Substituting this into the integral, we get:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \int_{0}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{4}{a^2} \sin^2\left(\frac{n \pi x}{a}\right) \mathrm{d} x
$$

Using the identity $\sin^2(x) = (1 - \cos(2x)) / 2$, we can rewrite this as:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{a^2} \int_{0}^{\frac{a}{2}} \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{2n \pi x}{a}\right)\right] \mathrm{d} x
$$

Evaluating this integral, we get:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{a^2} \left[\frac{x}{2} - \frac{a}{2 \pi n} \sin\left(\frac{2n \pi x}{a}\right)\right]_{0}^{\frac{a}{2}}
$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}- \frac{1}{\pi n } \sin (n \pi)
$$

Finally, using the fact that $\sin(n \pi) = (-1)^{n+1}$, we get the answer:

$$
\operatorname{Pr}\left(0 \leq x \leq \frac{a}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}+ \frac{1}{\pi n }(-1)^{n+1}

Assuming that the thrust force is constant and the rocket is fired vertically, the equation can be simplified to:

$$\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{F_{thrust}}{m}-g$$

Separating variables and integrating, we get:

$$\int_{0}^{v_f} dv = \int_{0}^{t_0} \left(\frac{F_{thrust}}{m} - g\right) dt$$

$$v_f = v_0 + \frac{F_{thrust}}{m}t_0 - gt_0$$

where \(v_0\) is the initial velocity of the rocket, \(t_0\) is the burn time, and \(m\) is the mass of the rocket at burnout.

$$|\sum \tau|=6.0 \mathrm{~N}(0.20 \mathrm{~m})=1.20 \mathrm{~N \cdot m}$$

The moment of inertia of the disk is given by:

$$I=0.5 m\left(0.10 \mathrm{~m}^2\right)=0.0050 \mathrm{~kg \cdot m^2}$$

The angular acceleration of the disk is given by:

$$\alpha=-24 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^2$$

Using the rotational equation of motion, we have:

$$|\sum \tau| = I \alpha$$

$$1.20 \mathrm{~N \cdot m}=(0.0050 \mathrm{~kg \cdot m^2})(-24 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^2)$$

$$v = r \omega = (0.10 \mathrm{~m})\left(-24 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^2\right)(2.5 \mathrm{~s}) = -6.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$$

The rotational kinetic energy of the disk is given by:

$$K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2$$

$$K = \frac{1}{2}(0.0050 \mathrm{~kg \cdot m^2})\left(\frac{-6.0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}}{0.10 \mathrm{~m}}\right)^2 = 180 \mathrm{~J}$$

Therefore, the rotational kinetic energy of the disk at $t = 2.5 \mathrm{~s}$ is 180 J."

The derivation of the equation for the radius of a spherical protein from the sedimentation coefficient, specific volume, density, and viscosity is correct. The values used for the parameters are appropriate and the final answer is reasonable for the size of a protein.\n\nHere are the steps to derive the equation for the radius of a spherical protein:\n\n1. Start with the equation for the sedimentation coefficient:\n\n```\ns = \frac{M \overline{v}}{\rho N_A f}\```\n\nwhere:\n\n* s is the sedimentation coefficient in seconds\n* M is the molar mass of the protein in kilograms per mole\n* \(\overline{v}\) is the partial specific volume of the protein in cubic meters per kilogram\n* \(\rho\) is the density of the solvent in kilograms per cubic meter\n* \(N_A\) is Avogadro's number\n* f is the frictional coefficient in newtons per meter per second\n\n2. The frictional coefficient for a spherical protein is given by the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\n```\overline{v} f = \frac{4 \pi \eta r}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\```\n\nwhere:\n\n* \(\overline{v}\) is the partial specific volume of the protein in cubic meters per kilogram\n* f is the frictional coefficient in newtons per meter per second\n* \(\eta\) is the viscosity of the solvent in pascal-seconds\n* r is the radius of the protein in meters\n* \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is Boltzmann's constant in joules per kelvin\n* T is the absolute temperature in kelvins\n\n3. Substitute the Stokes-Einstein equation into the equation for the sedimentation coefficient:\n\n```\ns = \frac{M \overline{v}}{\rho N_A}\left(\frac{4 \pi \eta r}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right)\```\n\n4. Rearrange the equation to solve for the radius of the protein:\n\n```\nr = \left(\frac{s \rho N_{\mathrm{A}} k_{\mathrm{B}} T}{4 \pi M \eta}\right)^{1 / 2}\```\n\n5. Use the given values for the parameters to calculate the radius of lysozyme:\n\n```\n\begin{aligned}\nr & =\left[\frac{\left(1.91 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{~s}\right)\left(0.998 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}\right)\left(6.022 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)\left(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\right)(293 \mathrm{~K})}{4 \pi\left(14,100 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)\left(1.002 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~Pa} \cdot \mathrm{s}\right)}\right]^{1 / 2} \\\ & =1.99 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m} \times\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~nm}}{1 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}}\right) \\\ & =1.99 \mathrm{~nm}\end{aligned}\```\n\nTherefore, the radius of lysozyme is 1.99 nm.}[SEP_TOKEN_WENDA]{'correctness': 'True', 'rationale': 'The rationale clearly and correctly explains the formula used to calculate the standard molar entropy of a monatomic ideal gas at 298.15 K and applies the formula correctly to calculate the molar entropy of Ne and Kr.

It correctly calculates the standard cell potential ($E\degree$) for the half-cell reaction $Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3e^- \rightarrow Fe(s)$ by adding the standard cell potentials for the two half-reactions provided: $Fe^{3+}(aq) + e^- \rightarrow Fe^{2+}(aq)$ and $Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow Fe(s)$.

"First, it states the given half-reactions and their standard cell potentials ($E\degree$) correctly."

"Then, it sets up the equation for calculating the overall $E\degree$ of the desired half-cell reaction using the standard cell potentials of the given half-reactions:"

$$E^\circ(\text{overall}) = E^\circ(\text{first half-reaction}) + E^\circ(\text{second half-reaction})$$

"Next, it substitutes the standard cell potentials of the given half-reactions into the equation:"

$$E^\circ(\text{overall}) = (+0.771 \mathrm{~V}) + (-0.447 \mathrm{~V}) $$
