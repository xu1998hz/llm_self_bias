This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that already enjoys wide acceptance, but also provides details unavailable from the fossil record, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to the scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut-colored in the upper part and pale or yellowish in the lower part.
The invention also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack the elaborate feather shaft, called a rachis, but have other defining features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers propose that a rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but more likely for display or temperature regulation. Although this was a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest the specimen shows an adult-like feather and not a baby chick.
Researchers suggest that although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult, not a hatchling.

They found that the sun operated according to the same basic principles as all other stars. It turned out that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
 Luminosity and rotation together are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to flux of the plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less the star is efficient in terms of magnetic inversions.

The large majority of the research carried out was theoretical, but the program was written to aid in observations of the Milky Way Galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter in the galaxy.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, creating tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists managed to come to the conclusion that dark matter exerts influence over another dark matter like regular matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter surrounding a galaxy forms a halo around the galaxy and comprises numerous small particles.
