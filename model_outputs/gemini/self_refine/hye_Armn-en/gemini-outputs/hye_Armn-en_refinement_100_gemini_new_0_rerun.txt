This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that already enjoys wide acceptance, but also provides details that the fossil record generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut coloured in the upper section and pale or yellowish in the lower,
The invention also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack the elaborate feather shaft, called a rachis, but have other hallmarks of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers propose that a rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but more likely for display or temperature regulation. Although this was a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest the specimen shows an adult-like feather and not a baby chick.
Researchers suggest that although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur , the specimen shows the feathers of an adult, not a hatchling.

The 802.11n standard operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies.
This will allow backward comaptibility with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g points, provided that the base station has dual radios.
802.11n speeds are substantially faster than its predecessors, which had a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mb/s.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written in order to foster observations from the Milky Way.
The effect the team was looking for arises from tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists managed to come to the conclusion that dark matter exerts influence over another dark matter like regular matter.
According to this theory, a large proportion of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy takes the guise of a corona consisting of numerous tiny particles.
