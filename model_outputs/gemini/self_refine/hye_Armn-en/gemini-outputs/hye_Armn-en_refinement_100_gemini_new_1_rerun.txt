This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that already enjoys wide acceptance, but also provides details that the fossil record generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut colored in the upper section and pale or yellowish in the lower.
The invention also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack the elaborate feather shaft, called a rachis, but have other hallmarks of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers propose that a rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but more likely for display or temperature regulation. Although this was a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers suggest the specimen shows an adult-like feather and not a baby chick.
Researchers suggest that although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult, not a hatchling.

The large majority of the research carried out was theoretical, but the program was written to aid in observations of the Milky Way Galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter in the galaxy.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists managed to come to the conclusion that dark matter exerts influence over another dark matter like regular matter.
According to this theory, the bulk of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is halo-shaped and surrounded by the galaxy, and is comprised of numerous tiny particles.
