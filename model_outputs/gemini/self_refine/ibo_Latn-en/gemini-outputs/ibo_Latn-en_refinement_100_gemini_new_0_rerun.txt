Initially, Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff said his company started when his home doorbell was stolen in a crime-ridden area where he parked his car.
He said he created a WiFi powered gangway.
Siminoff said sales skyrocketed after a 2013 appearance on the TV show "Shark Tank," where the hosts passed on the opportunity to invest in the startup.
By late 2017, Siminoff was shown on the QVC television shopping channel.
Ring has also settled a case it had with another home security company, ADT Corporation.
While one experimental vaccine has shown some promise in reducing the number of people who die from Ebola, no drug has yet been shown to effectively treat those infected with the disease.
One antibody, ZMapp, initially showed promise, but upon further examination proved less effective against preventing death than originally believed.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as the comparator arm, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline to which three other drugs could be compared.
USA Gymnastics supports the guidance provided by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and agrees it is time for everyone involved in the Olympic movement to work together to ensure a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We believe that the USOC can best serve the interest of our athletes, their sports and their country by making our internal structural reforms without revoking recognition of our fellow federations.
The U.S. Olympic gymnastics community endorsed an independent review that could examine whether the abuse of hundreds of athletes by former doctor Larry Nassar was part of a broader systemic failure and recommended changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a common goal - to enable the sport of gymnastics, and those who participate in it, to flourish in an environment where athletes can train and compete, and fans can enjoy the sport in a safe, fair, and equitable manner befitting the ideals of supporting a culture of excellence.
In 1960, Brzezinski was hired as an adviser by John F. Kennedy and served in the same capacity during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This suggests that, at least occasionally, dinosaurs were fat; most people would think so today, but otherwise it shows us what fossils cannot tell us, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fat of this particular animal is yellow on top and looks like carotenoids underneath.
The findings also provided clues about the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs.
For the most part the rachis has no major branching, which is called branching, but it has other features — such as barbs and barbules — that researchers say evolved later from these other structures.
Their wing arrangement suggests that they were used not for bounding flight, but rather for gliding warmth, or display. The authors suggest that although these represent early stages in the evolution of a wing, the displays were made with fully formed vanes, rather than filoplumes.
The explorers propose that, despite this being a juvenile footprint, the impressions show well-developed unguals, or claw-like projections, not typical of juvenile tracks.
