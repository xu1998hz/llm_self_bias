The discovery also offers insights into feathers' evolution in birds.
Because feathers didn't have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but did have barbules and barbs, researchers decided that the rachis was in all likelihood a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of feathers shows that they were not used for flying but for temperature control or show. Although this was a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than down, the researchers note.
Researchers said that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the fossil shows adult feathers, not chick feathers.

The work completed was mainly theoretical but a program was written to simulate observations that could be made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The fluctuation is caused by tidal forces between dark matter intervening galaxies and dark matter from the Milky Way.
As the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
Scientists concluded that this invisible material exerts its influence on other material in ways similar to the ways visible material exerts influence over also visible material.
This theory states that there is some dark matter which is located in a cluster realm in the circumgilation of a galaxy and that it consists of myriads of small particles.
