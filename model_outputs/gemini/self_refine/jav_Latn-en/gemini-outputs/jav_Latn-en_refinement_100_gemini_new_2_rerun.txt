A lone cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, originally had potential in the field, but laboratory findings have since revealed that it is of less use than initially anticipated in halting death.
During the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means scientists compared three treatments to it.
The United States Gymnastics organization applauds the letter by the United States Olympic Committee and agrees with its message that the Olympic family urgently needs to promote safe environments for all of its athletes.

The discovery also offers insights into feathers' evolution in birds.
Because feathers didn't have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but did have barbules and barbs, researchers decided that the rachis was in all likelihood a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of feathers shows that they were not used for flying but for temperature control or show. Although this was a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than down, the researchers note.
Researchers said that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the fossil shows adult-like feathers rather than feathers of a chick.

This time we are reminded that nothing can warrant the actions in Iraq at this time to escalate into sectarian war, spiralling violence or tipping into utter chaos.
The report opened with a call to open debate and build consensus in the United States about policy toward the Middle East.
The report is sharply critical of nearly every aspect of the administration's current Iraq policy and presses for a rapid change of course.
One of 78 recommendations was that a new diplomatic initiative should be undertaken before the end of the year to secure the Iraqi border from hostile infiltration and to re-establish diplomatic relations with neighboring states.

The work completed was mainly theoretical but a program was written to simulate observations that could be made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The fluctuation is caused by tidal forces between dark matter intervening galaxies and dark matter from the Milky Way.
As the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
Scientists concluded that this invisible material exerts its influence on other material in ways similar to the ways visible material exerts influence over also visible material.
This theory states that there is some dark matter which is located in a cluster realm in the circumgilation of a galaxy and that it consists of myriads of small particles.
