This does not just mean that there are dinosaurs that have fur, which is a theory that has been circulated, but there are usually no fossils that can be used as evidence, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
. Scientists say the shape of the animal's head is chestnut brown with a faded or scurf on the outline.
These findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds
Because dinosaur integument lacks the well-developed central shaft, or rachis, but exhibits several other feather features — a ramus and barbs — they conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers show that they were not used for flight but rather for display or temperature regulation. Researchers point out that although this was a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not downy feathers.
Researchers suggest that though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than a chick-like coat.

The work mostly remains theoretical, but a program has been written for a simulation of the observations to be made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers believe the change was driven by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
As the moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that this invisible matter exerts an influence on visible matter just as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that massive amounts of dark matter are surrounding a galaxy in halos, made up of many very small particles.
