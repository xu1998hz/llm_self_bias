The value of the house after repairs is 80,000 + 50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.	The value of the house after repairs is 150% of the original value, so the original value is 130,000 / 1.5 = $<<130000/1.5=86666.66666666666>>86,666.67.	Josh's profit is 130,000 - 86,666.67 = $<<130000-86666.66666666666>>43,333.33.	#### 43,333.33
James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 sprints a week.	Each sprint is 60 meters, so he runs 9 x 60 = <<9*60=540>>540 meters a week.	#### 540
Wendi gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the first two meals.	She needs to give her chickens 3 x 20 = 60 cups of feed in total.	This means, she needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal.	#### 20
Kylar needs to buy 16 glasses.	Every second glass costs 60% of the price, which is 5 * 60% = $<<5*60%=3>>3.	So, he will pay 5 + 3 + 5 + 3 + ... for 16 glasses.	This is an arithmetic series with the first term a = 5, the common difference d = 2, and the number of terms n = 16.	The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:	Sn = n/2 * (a + l)	where l is the last term.	In this case, l = a + (n - 1) * d = 5 + (16 - 1) * 2 = 31.	So, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is:	S16 = 16/2 * (5 + 31) = 8 * 36 = $<<8*36=288>>288.	#### 288
