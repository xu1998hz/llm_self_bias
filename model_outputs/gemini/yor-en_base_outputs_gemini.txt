It certainly wasn't the smallest dinosaur, that's for sure, but it does provide a glimpse into the dinosaur color and feather debate.
Scientists say the animal's fur is chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
That also gives the story of the lives of birds.
Because a feather rachis is not a solid rod, as is a quill, but has other feather parts—barbs and barbules—attached to it, some researchers have suggested that the rachis may be an evolutionary precursor to the quill.
It is believed that feathers were not used for flight in early dinosaurs, but for insulation or display. Evidence suggests that even if they were a type of proto-feather, their structure was more like modern down.
Researchers say that if the meat is from a dinosaur species, its texture is more like that of an adult than a juvenile.
