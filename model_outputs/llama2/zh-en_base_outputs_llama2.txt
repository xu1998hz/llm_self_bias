At the academic conference of Zhejiang University, a student sang the main theme song, and the research results amazed everyone - Xinhua Net
Use air to wash hands, judge respiratory disease by blowing air, and accurately search for haze sources. Last night, at the academic conference of Zhejiang University in 2016, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements won awards.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and their research covers various fields such as environmental science, mechanical engineering, energy, medicine, life science, and humanities education. From a simple curiosity, they have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have won domestic and international awards.
Biological sensor: Your family's medical doctor
Zhang Dingming's team from the Biomedical Engineering Department showcased a smartphone-sized biological sensor at the exhibition.
"Just breathe lightly into this device, and it can detect your body's health condition from the air you exhale."
Zhang Dingming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after taking a deep breath, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
A smart ring on the market can detect health conditions, generally detecting temperature and pulse parameters.
This biological sensor uses a new type of material, graphene, which has a high sensitivity to chemical elements. Its target is to more accurately and deeply detect the health condition of the human body.
Smart surgical light: The doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, the operating room also uses smart surgical lights.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Master's students Zhu Lin and Shen Junfei from the College of Optoelectronics and Electrical Engineering have broken new ground in the limitations of traditional surgical lamps and invented a smart LED surgical lamp with no shadows.
"Many diseases are difficult to detect in the early stages, and the lighting in the operating room is related to the doctor's performance."
Shen Junfeng said, for example, during early cancer screening, if the doctor cannot timely observe the entire tumor tissue, then the cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light panels, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the difference in organ tissues under illumination.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and transparency of the light based on the surgical needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical light has been used in several hospitals including Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the National Innovation Award for the first prize.
Wash hands with air: save water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water and soap, but Li Xiaoping and his classmates invented an "air-powered hand-washing device".
As long as we have the weight of the washing machine, we can squeeze out the air.
"It's like a pressure cooker."
Compress the air, form a fluid at the water dragon's mouth, and combine with water.
Let's wash our hands clean!
Experiment: The effect of hand sanitizer and ordinary hand washing methods is the same, as proven by this experiment.
This device only needs to rely on the gravity of our own body to drive it, both ensuring cleanliness and saving 90% of water, and the entire process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second global high-level challenge peak meeting, this invention emerged from numerous world-renowned universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to send me the replacement as soon as possible, thanks.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, don't accumulate, and never use #PRS_ORG# again!
Some dishes with bones and spicy food are not suitable for young children to eat.
If so, please place an order as soon as possible.
Thank you, but there is no temporary staff available.
He said to me, "Tell everyone where he is located." #PRS_ORG#
I don't want to wait, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can we change it?
Or cancel the order
Great, thank you.
A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license!
Spread the word: Emergency measures are actually rescue measures taken before the arrival of the rescue team during a sudden emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
Everyone knows that there is actually a period of time after the accident occurs and before the rescue car arrives, and it is during this period that the most critical moment occurs.
It's time for an urgent rescue now.
If my heart disease, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory failure really happens, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So, the people around you understand how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue them through professional knowledge, rather than standing there foolishly doing nothing, which is too frightening.
In China, our official data shows that there are 300 million people who die unexpectedly each year, and the most dangerous is sudden heart failure.
In the United States, the average person can save 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos, 70% of gamblers can recover their losses, while in Shanghai and Beijing, the percentage is below 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Luo Le, said.
If a person's heart stops beating, breathing stops, and there is no pulse, CPR is useless.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save a person's life.
I find that many people nowadays are not aware of the importance of learning first aid, but when an emergency occurs, they come to regret not having learned it. So I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond quickly in emergency situations.
It's hard to say if we can still save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid training at your local Red Cross branch, I signed up for it in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to accomplish before I turned 25, and adding the emergency certificate to the list of goals is something I did a few months ago, but I did actually accomplish it!
Next, I want to go for other certificates that I want to take, such as a scuba diving certificate, which I saw on Little Red Book before, and a scuba diving emergency certificate, which seems to be very useful!

Is 13 yuan for a dumpling?!
Never tried
How could #NAME# not write clearly?
How much is it? 13 yuan?
Did #PRS_ORG# send food yesterday? I'm just going to eat one shrimp dumpling!?
Because the code I input before was valid.
In conclusion, I personally believe that the movie "Four Seas" is a complete disaster from various perspectives.
But you have to admit that this movie is not without its bright spots, and the soundtrack is not bad either.
The movie has many forms, such as making you feel sleepy in the cinema, making you feel angry after watching it, and the movie is like a monkey on the Four Seas, it can ignite your anger in multiple ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Hàn Hán is truly a natural talent.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it's like a creation from the world of Kerouac's novels, with too many holes and imperfections, much like the windbreaker worn by Little Ma.
You may even doubt whether there is a hidden meaning behind the director's words, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is actually just a load of nonsense.
Simply put, there are some situations that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should reside in a small island located in a southern region, and his grandmother should be his lifeline.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the neighbors arranged for an old man to take her in his small bread truck to the northeast to see the snow.
Can an elderly person sit in a face-to-face car from the south to the northeast to see snow?
They are still very relaxed about it.
Then the old man just didn't show up.
How did the female owner of a hotel on a abandoned ship obtain a business license?
Why can the little devil in the flying car easily block a mountain road with just a few touches?
Then a truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road and the drivers of four surrounding trucks couldn't find each other.
This is too obvious, isn't it?
Why did a low-credit and law-breaking small hoodlum become a police auxiliary?
Why didn't you report high-interest loans? The police in the movie even specifically asked if there were any difficulties.
A middle-aged person who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use the hotel room card to open the door, and then can't find the hotel manager and ends up sleeping outside the room door?
The bizarre and absurd scenes are scattered throughout the entire film, making me feel painful whenever I recall them.
Except for the plot, the movie is even worse, or rather, it has no plot at all, and it's just a face-saving mess.
At first, you might think he's making a comedy film, but after 20 minutes, you might realize it's a motivational film. Watching half of it makes you think it might be a drama about the challenges of young people living in small towns, and after finishing it, you'll have no idea what kind of movie you just watched. It leaves you with a deep sense of confusion and wonder why you went to the cinema to watch something so... unusual.
For most people, it's actually quite familiar with various movie genres, such as how to make a motorcycle stunt, and then inspire and tell the audience a talented bird's journey from being a novice to success.
If you want to make a romantic movie, you should focus on the love story between the young man from the countryside and the service staff's younger sister.
If you want to reflect reality, then at least your story cannot contain elements that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yue Yue bought was just burned, but he can still sing like a bird.) He can't afford to buy a Kendini even if he wants to.
As for the female lead, she is not as weak-willed as some viewers may think, and her performance is not just a result of acting skills or the director's requirements, but rather a deliberate choice.
I also find it a bit strange that Han Han, as a race car driver, is so enthusiastic about adding a crash scene in his own movie.
Is it to pile on the pressure for viewers during the spring festival season?
