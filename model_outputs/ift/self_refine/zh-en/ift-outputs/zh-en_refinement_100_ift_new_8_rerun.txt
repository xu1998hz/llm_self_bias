Zhejiang University's Scholarship Year-up Student Sings Main Role Research Results Make Brain Hole Big Open - Xinhuanet
Using air to wash hands, judging the health of the mouth, and precise search for the source of the mist - Yesterday evening, at the 2016 Zhejiang University Academic Year Opening Ceremony, a series of brain-busting academic achievements were awarded.
These achievements are primarily researched by students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, and education. The students started with a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have already been awarded nationally and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor
Zhang Diying, a PhD student at the Biotechnology and Biomedical Sciences Department, demonstrated a smartphone-sized biological sensor that is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
"You only need to gently exhale, this device can detect the health status of your body from the airflow you exhale."
Zhang Di Ling introduced the sensor, which is connected to the smartphone, after exhaling air. The health report will be displayed on the phone.
Marketable smart handhelds can detect health status, which are generally checked for temperature, pulse, etc.
This suite of biological sensors uses a new type of material, carbon nanotubes, as its target element, with its highly sensitive "olfactory" allowing it to more deeply and accurately reflect physical health status.
Smart Surgery Light: The High-Skilled Eye of the Doctor
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention was awarded a silver award at the 44th Swiss National Invention Exhibition in Cologne.
The team of Zhang Linjing, Shi Junfei, and Zhang Jiaxin from the School of Electronics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has opened a new path by finding a solution to the shortcomings of traditional hand surgery lamps.
"Many diseases are detected early, removed, and related to the light used in the Surgery Room by the Doctor."
Shi Junkai said, for example, if early cancer checks are not done in time by doctors, then cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical light has four light disks, which can be adjusted through the light spectrum to increase the visibility of different organizations in the light.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, light spectrum, and color uniformity of the light spots based on the needs of the surgery and personal preferences.
This intelligent surgical light has already been tried out at Zhejiang University Medical School Affiliated Hsueh-Yu-Fu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical School Affiliated Children's Hospital, with good feedback.
Last year, this invention received a first-place award in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash your hands: Saving water and Cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, mostly using soap and hand sanitizer, while Li Kai Zhang and his classmates invented a "Air Wash Machine"
As soon as you step onto the washing machine, our weight can compress the Air.
"It's like a breath of fresh air."
Compressed air, at the water faucet, forms a fluid and combines with water.
This way, we can wash our hands!
The color reaction and bacterial residue tests have proven: Through this method of washing hands, the effectiveness is the same as the usual washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, ensuring the cleaning process and saving 90% of water, the entire process is completely no-cost, environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second-largest global challenge summit, this invention was able to stand out among many world-top-level schools and win the only gold award.
Please arrange a replacement as soon as possible, thanks.

一个很有意义的一本证书——急救证
This is one of the most important skills certifications I have, aside from my driver's license!
Basic first aid: Emergency measures are actually done to prevent sudden events from happening, such as before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that in the process of emergency medical care, the time it takes for emergency vehicles to arrive is actually the most crucial.
This is the time when you need urgent care.
If my heart really does have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or a sudden stop in breathing, my life window only has four minutes, golden four minutes!
So, having someone around you who knows how to perform first aid is so important!
When someone falls down next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to perform first aid, rather than just standing there helplessly, which can be a very scary feeling.
In China, our official data shows that over 300,000 people die unexpectedly every year, with the most dangerous being heart attacks.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be rescued.
In Las Vegas's Casino Hotel, 78% Can Save You, Lower Than 1% In Shanghai And Beijing.
This is what the first reaction founders said.
If someone has a heart attack, breathing stops, and the heartbeat stops, you can't do anything to stop it.
You must do artificial breathing and chest compression to be able to save a person.
I found that we have very few people with this kind of awareness to learn first aid, but when the event happens, it's too late, so I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react quickly to sudden situations.
It may be possible to save someone's life!
You can register for emergency medical training at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Pearl Harbor Red Cross Training Center, and the students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of your own 25th birthday goal, including the emergency certificate added to the target list, which was several months ago, but actually completed!
Next, you need to go and get other certifications you want to get, such as the scuba diving certificate. I saw it on Tikalok before, it looks like you need to have an emergency certificate to get a scuba diving certificate. So, it looks like an emergency certificate is actually quite useful!

First, the conclusion: I personally think that the movie "Four Seas" is a complete piece of garbage, from all angles.
But you have to say that this movie is not a bright spot either, that's not at least a good choice for the music.
The film is divided into many types, allowing you to fall into a deep sleep in the cinema. Let's say you're done watching, you feel a surge of anger. The film "Four Seas" for the audience is like a monad on Mount Pele. It can use many ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of ridiculing the audience, Hank is truly a natural talent.
This part of the film that makes you feel the most pain is that it seems like a scene from a horror movie, difficult to name, with many holes like a mafia boss's windbreaker.
You may even doubt if there is a hidden message in the film, but after careful thought you will find it is just a pile of shit.
First, let me explain some things I don't understand.
The man's home should be in the southern part of the island, and he relies on his mother for his life.
Grandmother has a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged the neighboring big guy to open the small face-pack car and send her to the northeast to see the snow.
Older adults sitting on a bread basket from the South to the North looking at the snow?
He and his dad are very relaxed about this.
Then this old man just didn't have any more words.
How did the sister of the owner of the abandoned ship get a business license?
Why can the small mixers of the island fly cars so easily make a segment of the mountain road into a dead end?
Then a steel-beaked card truck stops in the middle of the road, and all around the card truck drivers cannot find it.
This tool is too obvious.
Why would a small-time crook with a bad credit record and a history of criminal charges become a volunteer police officer?
Why don't you report high interest debt? In the movie, the police even asked if you had a hard time?
A middle-aged man knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room key, then arranges to find the hotel manager and sleeps outside the room door?
This bizarre scene pervades the entire film, due to the absurdity of the situation, which makes me feel pain when I remember them.
Besides the holidays, the worst thing is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's a monstrous patchwork.
The video starts with you thinking it's going to be a funny video, 20 minutes later you guess it might be a motivational video, looking at half the time you think it might be a piece of film that shows the hard life of small-town youth, looking at the end you don't know what you're looking at, and then comes the deep-seated doubt of yourself, and then the big holiday of Christmas to run to the Cinema to Enjoy the Big Pooch.
For most people, it's actually quite familiar with various types of movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle rider, then just tell the audience a highly skilled and motivated person is like.
If you want to take a love photo, you can just be honest and straightforward about your love for the motorbike-riding small-town youth and the waitress. 🌿
If you want to reflect reality, at least your story cannot contradict the real world.

女主明明不是弱智可在某些方面表现的就像个5岁小孩，我真不知道这是演技的原因还是导演的要求。
I also have a point I am curious about, why is Korean racing driver Hank Kim so eager to add crash scenes to his own movie?
This way of filming during the Chinese New Year festival, is it to give the audience a headache?
