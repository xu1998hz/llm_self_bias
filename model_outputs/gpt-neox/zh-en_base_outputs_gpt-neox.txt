Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent this from happening again.
How long will it take for the restaurant to be ready? Can you ask them for me?
The students sang the main character of the research at the annual meeting of the graduate students of Peking University.
Use air to wash hands, cough to judge disease, accurately search for fog sources
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life science, humanities, and so on. The students started from a curious point, and created many high-tech inventions with great value, some of which have won awards in China and abroad.
Your family doctor is a biometric sensor.
The Bio-Medical Engineering and Electronics Engineering College Professor Zhang Dingxin's team is currently showing a smart phone-sized bio-sensing device at the exhibition.
“You only need to take a deep breath, and this device will be able to detect your body’s health status from the gases you exhale.”
Zhang Dejiang introduced that this sensor is connected with smart phones, and the health report will be displayed on the smart phone.
A smart health ring can be used to detect health conditions in the market.
This biosensor uses a new material called silicon carbide, which targets chemical elements. Its “smell” sensor is sensitive, and it can accurately reflect the health of the body.
Smart surgery light: Doctor's high-level eyes
Besides smart phones, the operating room also uses smart surgical lights.
This invention was awarded the Nobel Prize in the 44th annual Swiss Invention Exhibition.
The graduate students of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Zhiyong Lin and Shuangjie Feng, invented a new idea to solve the problem of traditional surgical lights. They invented a smart LED surgical light.
“Many diseases are detected and removed at an early stage, which is related to the lighting in the surgery room.”
Mr. Shun said that if doctors cannot see all the cancerous tissues during the early stage of cancer diagnosis, then the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgery lamp has four light bars, which can adjust the light spectrum to enhance the difference between different organizations under the same light.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, color, and the amount of shadow of the spot light according to the needs of the surgery and the personal habit.
This kind of intelligent surgery lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University Medical College affiliated hospital, Zhejiang University Medical College affiliated children's hospital, and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
This invention won the National Invention Award in October last year.
Use air dryer to dry hands.
The normal people wash their hands with water, but only wipe their hands with a little soap, and use a little hand sanitizer. However, Li Keqiang and his classmates invented a "air hand washing device".
Just stand on the scale and we can compress the air out.
It is like a fire extinguisher.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water dragon's head.
This way, we can keep our hands clean!
The color reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of the ordinary method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness of the process, and can save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-saving, energy-saving.
In the last year, this invention won the top prize in the world's most prestigious universities.

A certificate of merit for emergency rescue
This is one of the skills I think is important besides the pilot license!
The following is a brief introduction to emergency rescue.
The rescue team arrived after the accident.
This is the time when we need to rescue.
If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or breathing stops, then our life's window is only four minutes, four golden minutes!
So the people around you know how important it is to be able to perform first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue him by using professional knowledge instead of standing there doing nothing.
In China, there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous is heart attack.
In the United States, on average, 15% of the people can be saved.
In Las Vegas, the casino can save 70% of the people. Shanghai and Beijing are less than 1%.
This is the first reaction of the founder of the Yorba Foundation, Li Lu.
If a person has a heart attack, breathing stops, and heartbeats stop, you can't do anything to help.
The patient must be given artificial respiration and chest compression to be rescued.
I found that we are still lacking people who are willing to learn emergency rescue skills. However, when the situation happens, it is too late. Therefore, I would like to encourage everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond quickly when faced with an emergency.
It might be able to save a life!
Emergency certificates can be applied for at your local Red Cross training center. I applied for mine at the Red Cross training center in Haikou. Students can also get a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I set for myself when I was 25 years old. The addition of the emergency card to the target list is also a matter of months ago, but it was indeed completed!
Next, you need to go to the other certificate you want to take. You can take a diving certificate. You can also take a first aid certificate.
I ordered #NUMBER#
13 yuan for a bowl of shrimp dumplings!?
I have not tried it.
How can #NAME# not write clearly?
How much is it?
Last night #PRS_ORG# lost some food, this time I only got one shrimp dumpling!?
Because I saw that the code I entered was valid before.
First of all, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a total piece of crap, from all aspects.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight and it is not even good, so it is not even good at least for the music.
There are many kinds of bad films, and you can sleep peacefully in the cinema, and you can also be angry after watching it, and the film "Four Seas" is like a monkey on the top of the mountain, it can use many ways to ignite your anger.
In the aspect of insulting the audience, Han San is really talented.
This movie is the most painful one. It is like a clone of the novel "The Three-Body Problem" by Cixin Liu.
Even after you watch it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you think about it carefully, you will find it is just a pile of shit.
I will try to explain some of the events in a simple way.
The male should live in a place that is located in the southern part of the country, and he should be close to his mother.
She wants to see snow and then the story will arrange for a big uncle in the village to drive her to the northeast to see snow.
A senior citizen sits on a bread cart and travels from the south to the north to see the snow?
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then this old man has no more text.
The hotel is on a decommissioned ship, how did the owner of the hotel get a business license?
Why did the islanders build a road without any difficulty?
Then the truck carrying steel cables stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the other trucks could not find it.
This item is too obvious.
Why would a gang of small-time thieves become a police officer?
Why didn't you report the high interest rate? The police in the movie asked you if you had any difficulties.
A grown-up person who knows how to use a smart phone, but does not know how to use a hotel room card, and then forces the hotel to find the hotel manager, and then sleeps in the corridor?
This is a strange story that is full of plot twists. I remember them all the time and it makes me feel sad.
The film's plot is worse than the story, or in other words, the film has no plot at all. It is a disgusting patchwork.
The first 20 minutes of the film, you think it's a comedy, but after half an hour, you think it's a drama about the difficulties of rural youth. After the film, you don't know what you've just watched. You are left with a deep doubt about yourself. Why did you come to the cinema to watch a shit?
For most people, the process of making a movie is very familiar. For example, if you want to make a movie about a stuntman, you should inspire yourself and tell the audience how a talented cook became a successful stuntman.
If you want to make a love story, then you should tell the story of a young man and a waitress who are in love with each other in a small town.
If you want to reflect reality, your story should not contain anything that is contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new Mao Zedong that was burned and then sang a song) cannot be played by someone who does not have the brain of a Kennedy.
As for the female lead, she is not stupid, but she is not very smart. She is like a 5-year-old child in some aspects. I don't know if it is the director's demand or the actress's performance.
I also wonder why Han Seong is so fond of adding car crashes in his own movies.
Is this movie schedule in the Spring Festival edition to block the audience?
