Zhejiang University Annual Conference: Students Performing as Leading Actors, Research Results Making People's Minds Wander - New China Net
Using air to wash hands, sniffing air to diagnose diseases, and accurately searching for mist and pollutants sources. Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Conference, a series of groundbreaking scientific achievements were awarded recognition.
These remarkable researchers are all students, covering a wide range of topics such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science, and educational science. From a curious spark, their creativity has resulted in many valuable inventions which have already won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biometric Sensor: Your Family Doctor
The biomedical engineering team at the university showed off a smartphone-sized biometric sensor. It was half the size of a regular smartphone.
You just need to take a few breaths, and this device can detect your body's health conditions from the components of the breath you exhale.
Zhang Di Ming introduces the sensor and smartphone connection, which will alert you to the presence of pollutants and display your health report on your phone.
Smart health wristbands can be detected in the market, generally detecting temperature, heart rate and other physical parameters.
This biometric sensor uses a new type of material, such as ink and stone, to detect chemical elements. Its sensitive "whistle" makes it possible to detect body health conditions in a deeper and more accurate way.
Smart Surgical Light: Physician's High-End EyewearOutput:Smart Surgical Light: Physician's High-End Eyewear
Besides smartphones, the surgery room has also started using smart surgical lights.
This invention won a gold medal at the 44th Swiss Invention Show in 20
Zhu Lin and Shen Junfei from the Institute of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up a new approach to traditional surgical lamps by inventing the Smart LED Surgical Light.
Many diseases are detected and removed in the early stage, and the light used in conjunction with the doctor's surgery is related.
Shen Junfei said, for example, when checking for early signs of cancer, doctors may not be able to identify all the tumor organs in time, which means the cancer cells will continue to spread afterwards.
This type of smart surgical light has four light panels, adjusting the spectral distribution of light to enhance the difference between different tissues illuminated by light.
During the surgical process, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency according to the surgical needs and the individual's habits at any time.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in the affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University and other hospitals. It has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the National Challenge Cup, the highest honor.
Using air to wash hands: Saving water and cooling down.
A person washing their hands is simply using water to rub, scrubbing with a bar of soap, squeezing out the soap and water mixture, and Chinese inventors such as Qi Zhilong have since then invented a "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the device for washing hands, our weight will be able to compress the air out.
"It's like a fire extinguisher."
The compressed air, formed a fluid at the tail of the dragon, combined with water.
That's great, we can finally get our hands clean!
Experimental evidence shows that the effect of this method of washing hands is the same as the ordinary washing method.
This device relies on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring a high level of cleanliness while saving up to 90% of water. It is completely environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Great Challenge Summit, this invention was unveiled at many world-renowned universities and won the only gold prize.

It is meaningful to have a rescue certificate——It is a life-saving document.
This is one of the important skills certificates I feel is essential besides a driving license!
General: Emergency measures are actually implemented when a sudden event occurs, i.e. rescue operations before the rescue vehicle arrives.
It is commonly known that the process of rescuing a car after an accident takes some time, and the most important time is this short period.
This is the time when we need to rescue quickly.
If I really had a heart disease, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory failure, our life window would be only four minutes, gold four minutes!
Therefore, it is important to have people who understand first aid around you!
When someone is in danger and we are nearby, we can use professional knowledge to help them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is helpless and frightening.
In China, there are over 300,000 unexpected deaths per year, making heart disease the leading cause of sudden death.
In the United States, the average rate of successful rescue is 15%.
At the casino hotel in Las Vegas, seventy-eight percent of the people who come out of it are saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below one percent.
This is the first reaction from the founder of the company, Lu Le.
If someone experiences heart blockage, breathing stops, heart stops, you should not perform CPR as it has no effect.
We must do artificial respiration, chest compression and external cardiac massage to possibly save a person.
I have discovered that there are still few people who have this kind of mind to learn and save quickly, but when the situation happens, they come too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make the right reaction at the right time when facing the unexpected situation.
You never know, you might be able to save a life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I am registering at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and students get discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I set for myself 25 years ago and adding the first-aid certification to the list of goals was several months ago, but it has definitely been accomplished!
After that, I want to take the other exams I'm planning to take, such as a scuba diving certificate. I saw in the Little Red Book that there is also a scuba diving rescue certificate, so I think I need to take that one as well in order to be able to take the exam. Therefore, a scuba diving rescue certificate is actually very useful!

Firstly, I believe 'The Four Seas' is a comprehensive satire, from various perspectives.
But you have to say this movie is not a highlight and it's not at least entertaining, so it can't be a good choice.
There are many kinds of horror movies, allowing you to enter a dreamy state in the cinema, making you feel satisfied after watching and filling your soul with terror. 'The Four Seas' is like a monkey on Mount Emei, able to use countless ways to ignite your anger.
On being criticized for this point, Han Cang really is a heaven-sent gentleman.
The most painful part of the movie is the creature, which is a copy of the creature from the novel "Frankenstein". It is hard to describe, but its clothes are like a cloak that is constantly falling apart.
After you read it, you will wonder if there is a hidden message conveyed here, but when you think about it carefully, it turns out to be just a load of crap.
First, I'll explain some difficult situations I have trouble understanding.
The man's place of residence should be on a certain small island in the south, and he should live in harmony with his wife.
She wished to see the snow and so the story was arranged for her to go to the northeast to see the snow with a big uncle driving a small sled.
Are old people sitting in a caravan from the south to the east to see snow?
He and his father are very relaxed about it.
Then this old man didn't have any more words to say.
How did the woman get the business license to operate a hotel on a abandoned boat?
On the island, the Flying Car Party is able to quickly and easily pave a section of mountain road by simply pressing a few buttons. Why?
Then the car with the steel rod was parked on the side of the road, and the four surrounding drivers could not find it.
This feeling is too obvious.
Why would a party of suspected illegal activities and violations become a police auxiliary?
Why don't you report the high-interest loan in the movie, and the police asked if there is any difficulty?
A grown man knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room key to open the hotel door, so he forces himself to look for the hotel staff and sleeps outside the hotel room door.
This kind of complicated plot twists can be found throughout the entire movie, and due to the plot being too convoluted, I often forget it and it even hurts when I remember it.
Besides the plot, the main message of the movie is also unclear, or it can be said that the movie has no main message at all, it's just a superficial and convoluted mess.
You will think it is a comedy at the beginning, but after 20 minutes it might be a motivational film. After watching half of it, you might think it is a drama that tries to portray the struggles of young adults in the suburbs. In the end, you will be left with doubts and questions. Why would you run to the movie theater to watch it?
For most people, it is quite familiar with various film genres, such as you want to shoot a car chase, then you motivate + comedy, then tell the audience one step by step how a bird given a chance is walking towards success.
If you want to take a love picture, then you just need to talk about the old grudge between the young people and the service staff in the small town.
If you want to reflect reality, you should avoid introducing abnormal elements into your story that could conflict with normal worldly affairs.
(For example, the new character played by Zhang Ziyi in "The Burning of the Midnight Lamp" was burned and then still able to sing, so you can't open some of the doors in the house to watch the movie.) You will not be able to open some of the doors in the house to watch the movie.
With regards to the female lead in "The Dark Knight", I don't know if it's because of her lack of intelligence or the director's requirements, but she behaves like a 5-year-old in certain aspects.
There's also something I don't understand. Why is HanCang so passionate about adding car chase scenes to his own films?
This kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival, is it to give the audience a surprise?
