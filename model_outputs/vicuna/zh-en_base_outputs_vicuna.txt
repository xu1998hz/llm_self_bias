Do you have any means to punish him?
Avoid repeating such incidents.
May I ask how long it will take for the restaurant to prepare the food? Or is there anything else I can help you with?
On the academic conference of Zhejiang University, students sang the main theme song, and their research results made people's brains "open up".
Use air to wash your hands, ha! Judge the disease by your breath, and accurately search for the source of the haze. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were awarded.
These achievements are mainly studied by students, covering environmental, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities, and education fields. From a curious point, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor### Explanation:The Chinese text "生物传感器" (Biological Sensor) refers to a device that can detect and measure biological signals or information from the human body. In English, this is translated as "Biological Sensor."The English text "Your Family Doctor" refers to a person who is responsible for providing healthcare services to a family or group of people. In Chinese, this is translated as "你的家庭体检医生" (Nǐ de jiātíng tǐyuán yīshēng), which literally means "Your Family Doctor."
The Biomedical Engineering Department's Ph.D. student team, Zhang Dingyun, demonstrated a smartphone-end biological sensor on the spot. The size of the sensor was only half the size of a smartphone.
You only need to take a deep breath, and this device can initially detect your body's health condition from the components of the air you exhale.
Translate the Chinese text into English.The introduction by Zhang Di is that this set of sensors is connected to smartphones, and when air is called out, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Translate the Chinese text into English.The instruction describes a task of translating Chinese text into English. The Chinese text describes a type of smart ring that can detect health conditions on the market. The ring generally detects physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
The bio-sensor used a new material called graphene, which is a target for chemical elements. The sensitive "smell" of the sensor allows it to more accurately and deeply reflect the health status of the body.
Intelligence surgical light: Surgeons' high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, surgical rooms have also started using smart surgical lights.
The invention won a silver medal at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition held in Geneva this year.
The master's student Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfeng team from the College of Optoelectronics and Engineering started a new approach in the deficiencies of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
The early detection and removal of many diseases is not accurate, and it is related to the light used in the operating room by doctors.
Shen Junfeng said, for example, when performing an early-stage cancer screening, if the doctor cannot quickly identify all tumor tissues, the cancer cells will continue to spread afterward.
The intelligent surgical light has four light bulbs, and by adjusting the spectrum, it enhances the difference between different tissues under illumination.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and transparency of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits, at any time.
This type of smart surgical light has been used in Zhejiang University Medical Center, Zhejiang University Children's Hospital, and other hospitals for trial use, and has received relatively good feedback.
Last year in October, this invention won the first prize in the national challenge cup.
Use air to wash your hands: Save water and be cool.
The instruction is to translate Chinese text into English. The Chinese text describes a task of washing hands. The task is to use water to wash hands, add some soap, squeeze the hands, and use hand sanitizer. The English text describes a similar task of washing hands. The task is to use water to wash hands, add some soap, squeeze the hands, and use hand sanitizer. The English text also mentions that some people, like Li Qichang and his classmates, have invented an "air washing machine" for washing hands.
As long as we stand on the installed hand sanitizer, our weight can squeeze the air out.
"Just like a gas canister."
Compress the air and form a fluid at the water tap. Mix with water.
"This way, we can wash our hands clean!"
Conclusion: The results of the color reaction and bacterial residue experiment demonstrate that the effectiveness of hand washing is the same as that of a conventional hand washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleaning effectiveness while saving 90% of water and energy. The entire process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class schools and won the only gold award.

Please don't worry.
A certificate that feels meaningful - Emergency Certificate
This is a skill certificate that I think is important besides my driver's license!
Promote the knowledge: Emergency rescue measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken before the arrival of the rescue team, that is, rescue before being rescued.
The common knowledge is that when the ambulance arrives at the scene of an accident, there is still a certain period of time before the actual rescue operation begins. It is precisely during this period of time that is the most critical.
The Chinese text "这个时候便是需要急救的时候" can be translated into English as "It is the time that requires immediate rescue."
If I really have a heart attack, stroke, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life only has four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, how important is it for people around you to know first aid?
When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying.
In China, our official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden heart failure.
The average rate of survival in the United States is 15%.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70% to 80% of the guests are saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, the percentage is below 1%.
Translate the Chinese text into English.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no pulse, CPR (chest compressions) is not effective.
To save a person, it is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression.
I have found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
The Chinese text means "Maybe we can still save a person's life!"
Urgent rescue certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are also discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve by the time I'm 25 years old. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but I did accomplish it!
After that, I want to take other certifications that I want to take, such as the scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is a diving emergency certification that you can take, and it seems that you need the emergency certification to take the scuba diving certification. So it turns out that the emergency certification is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
Do you think 13 yuan's shrimp dumplings are a good deal?
Have you tried it?
How do you write #NAME# without it being clear?
Question: Is this 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS\_ORG# leaked food, this time just give me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I saw that the code I input before was effective.
First, I would like to conclude that I believe "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive and excellent movie from all aspects.
But you have to say that this movie is not a highlight either, and that's not even good enough for the music selection.
The movie is divided into many genres, and it is one of the types that can make you feel sleepy in the cinema. It is also one of the types that can make you feel angry after watching it. "The Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Hyun-Ryu is truly a genius.
The part of the movie that makes people feel the most pain is that it seems to be a creation from the world of Cixi's novels, difficult to name, with many holes like the wind coat on Little Mao's body.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there is an implied metaphor in the director's work, but when you carefully think about it, you will find that it is actually just a piece of shit.
Please briefly describe some of the plot points that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should reside in a small island located in the southern part of China, and he should be dependent on his grandmother for support.
The grandmother has a wish to see the snow, and then the story arranges for an old man in the neighborhood to take her on a small bread truck to the northeast to see the snow.
Do you think an elderly person would sit on a bread truck from southern China to the northeast to see snow?
He and his father are very relieved about this.
After that, the old man didn't write anymore.
Translate the Chinese text into English.### Answer:The question is asking how the female protagonist in a novel or movie obtained a business license for a hotel located on a derelict ship.
Why can the flying car gang on the island easily block a mountain road?
After that, the cement truck stopped in the middle of the road and the cement truck driver couldn't find the cement trucks around him.
The tooling is too obvious.
Why would a small gang of delinquents who are unemployed and have criminal suspicions become police assistants?
Why don't you report high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
A middle-aged person understands how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a hotel room card to open the door in a hotel and then arranges to find the hotel manager and sleeps outside the room door for a night?
The plot of this movie is full of such bizarre and absurd events that they are too outrageous to be believed. As a result, whenever I remember them, I feel a sense of pain and discomfort.
The problem with this movie is not just the plot, but also its theme, or rather, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a grotesque patchwork of clichés.
The video starts with the assumption that he wants to make a comedy film. After 20 minutes, you may guess that it could be a motivational film. While watching half of it, you may think it could be a drama that portrays the difficulties of life in a small town. After watching it all, you will have no idea what kind of film you watched, and you will feel a deep doubt about why you went to the cinema to watch it during the Spring Festival.
For most people, it is actually quite familiar with the plot of various types of movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle stuntman, you can use inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented chef became successful step by step.
If you want to make a romantic movie, then you should realistically portray the love triangle between the motorcycle-riding young man from the small town and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your story should not contain things that are inconsistent with the normal world.
（For example, the character played by Yan Zhiyuan in the new motorcycle movie that was burned and could still sing, shouldn't he be able to resist the inevitable hole in the brain when he meets Kendrick Lamar?)
The female lead in this drama is not necessarily a weak-minded person who can only express herself like a 5-year-old child in some ways. I'm not sure if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
Still, there's one thing I'm not quite sure about. Why is Lee Hwan-gyu, as a professional racing driver, so passionate about adding a collision scene in his own movie?
Do you think the arrangement of such a movie in the Spring Festival season is to give the audience a headache?
