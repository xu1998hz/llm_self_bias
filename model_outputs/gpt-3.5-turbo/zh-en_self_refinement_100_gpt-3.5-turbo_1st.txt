Is there a way to punish him?
In order to avoid such incidents from happening again.
Or how much longer will the restaurant take to prepare? Can you help me ask?
Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference: Students Take the Lead Role, Research Results Spark Imagination - Xinhua News
Using air to wash hands, judging diseases by exhaling, accurately searching for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, and some of these projects have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensor: Your Family Health Doctor
The doctoral student Zhang Diming's team from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated an on-site smart phone-based biosensor, which is only half the size of a smart phone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and this set of equipment can preliminarily detect your physical health condition from the composition of the exhaled gas."
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
The smart wristbands available on the market can generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse to monitor health conditions.
This set of biosensors uses a new material called graphene, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of physical health.
Intelligent surgical lamp: The high-energy eyes of doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also being used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless light.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed early enough, which is related to the lights used in the operating room by doctors."
Shen Junfei said that, for example, during early cancer screening, if doctors cannot timely identify all tumor tissues, then cancer cells will continue to spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing them with water, at most using a little soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students have invented a "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's washbasin, our weight can compress the air and come out.
"Like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove that the effectiveness of hand washing using this method is the same as that of regular hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to make it up to me as soon as possible, thx.

Bone and spicy pickled vegetables are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#
I'm not waiting anymore, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order.
Okay, thank you for your trouble.
A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates that I consider important besides my driver's license!
Just to popularize: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures when sudden incidents occur, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time before the ambulance arrives after an accident occurs, and it is during this period of time that is the most crucial.
This is the time when emergency assistance is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window of our lives is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is so important for the people around to know first aid!
When someone around us collapses, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there motionless and unable to do anything, which is a terrifying feeling of helplessness.
"In China, according to official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being cardiac arrest."
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved nationwide.
In Las Vegas casinos, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, without breathing or a heartbeat, pinching the person's acupoint will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save a person's life.
I found that very few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it's too late when something happens, so I still appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can react promptly when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can even save someone's life!
You can register for the first aid certificate at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can also enjoy discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
Next, I'm going to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried.
How come #NAME# didn't write it clearly?
One is 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering the food, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because clearly I saw that the code I entered earlier was valid.
First of all, let me state my conclusion: I personally believe that "Four Seas" is a completely terrible film in every sense.
But if you say that this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not entirely true. At least the music selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one that makes you fall asleep in the cinema is one type, and one that makes you indignant after watching it is another type. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from the Kexi novels, indescribable and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Xiaoma's body.
Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a piece of shit.
First, let me briefly explain some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist's place of residence should be on a small island in the southern part, where he relies on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her in a small van to Northeast China to see the snow.
Elderly people of advanced age take a minibus from the south to the northeast to see the snow?
He and his father are still very reassured about this.
Then the old man didn't say anything else.
How did the protagonist's brother obtain the business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the gang of hooligans on the island easily block off a section of mountain road with their motorcycles?
Then the truck delivering steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere nearby.
This prop feels too obvious, right?
Why would a small gangster with a bad credit history and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't you report to the police when facing high-interest loans? In the movie, the police even asked if there were any difficulties.
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcefully arranges to find the hotel owner but ends up sleeping outside the room for a night.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plots are so absurd that they even cause me pain when I recall them.
Apart from the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a hideous patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think that he wants to make a comedy, but after more than 20 minutes, you guess that it might be an inspirational film. When you are halfway through, you feel that it may be a drama that reflects the hardships of young people in small towns. After watching it, you have no idea what you have actually watched, followed by a deep self-doubt. Why did you go to the cinema to appreciate feces during the Chinese New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, it should be a combination of inspirational and comedic elements, telling the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success.
If you want to shoot a love film, then you should honestly tell the story of the love and grudges between a young man who likes riding motorcycles and a waitress in a small town.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least your plot cannot include things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played was just burned, and then there is a character who can still sing), so we can't come up with some brainstorms that even Kennedy couldn't bear to watch.
As for the female lead, she is clearly not mentally disabled, but she behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is one more thing that I can't quite understand. Why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so enthusiastic about adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to give the audience trouble?
