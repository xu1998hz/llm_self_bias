Janet eats 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs every day.	So, she has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs left to sell.	Therefore, she makes 9 x 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmers' market.	#### 18
The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, so it takes 2 + 2/2 = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts in total.	#### 3
The increase in value of the house is 150% of $50,000, which is 150/100 * $50,000 = $75,000.	So the value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.	Therefore, Josh made a profit of $155,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $25,000.	#### 25,000
James runs 3 sprints x 60 meters = <<3*60=180>>180 meters each time he runs.	He runs 180 meters x 3 times a week = <<180*3=540>>540 meters in total each week.	#### 540
Wendi gives her chickens a total of 15 + 25 = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon.	Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per meal, so for 20 chickens, Wendi needs to give them 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed in total.	Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.	#### 20
Kylar needs to buy 16/2 = 8 glasses at the regular price.	He needs to buy another 16/2 = 8 glasses at the discounted price.	For the regular price glasses, he needs to pay 8 * $5 = $40.

Charleston has 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 sheep.	Toulouse has 2 * 80 = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep.	Together, they have 160 + 80 + 20 = <<160+80+20=260>>260 sheep.	#### 260
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it would normally take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the file.	However, 40% of the way through the download, she has to restart, which takes an additional 20 minutes.	So, she has already spent 100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes downloading before the restart.	After the restart, she has to start from the beginning, so she will need another 100 minutes to download the file.	Therefore, it will take Carla a total of 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes to download the file.	#### 160
In the first 3 hours, John travels 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 miles.	In the next 2 hours, he doesn't move, so he doesn't change his distance from home.	In the next half-hour, he travels 0.5 * 30 = <<0.5*30=15>>15 miles.	In the remaining 1.5 hours, he travels 1.5 * 80 = <<1.5*80=120>>120 miles.	So in total, John is 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = <<180+0+15+120=315>>315 miles from home. 	#### 315
For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns 40 * $10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.	For the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza earns 5 * $10 * 1.2 = $<<5*10*1.2=60>>60.	Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week is $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460.	#### 460
In the second month, there were 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 downloads.	In the third month, there were 180 - (180 x 0.30) = <<180-(180*0.30)=126>>126 downloads.	In total, there were 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366 downloads over the three months.	#### 366
The cost of 3 dozen donuts is 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.	The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.	The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.	The total cost is $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.	#### 694
Each year, Carlos earns 7 x $1.5 = $10.5 from selling lemons.	Each year, Carlos spends $3 on watering and feeding the tree.	So, Carlos earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year from the lemon tree.	Carlos needs $90 / $7.5 = 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.	#### 12
Let's work backwards to find the answer. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then before selling to the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 vacuum cleaners.	Before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12 vacuum cleaners.	Before selling to the green house, she had 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 vacuum cleaners.	So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.	#### 36
The number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4.	So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students remained.	The number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4.	Therefore, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.	The percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 x 100% = <<12/20*100=60>>60%.	#### 60%
The increase in value for the jewelry would be 5000 * 0.025 = $125.	The increase in value for the electronic gadgets would be 8000 * 0.012 = $96.	Therefore, the merchant would make a profit of 125 - 96 = $29 by choosing the jewelry.	#### 29
Both trains traveled a total of 80 + 150 = <<80+150=230>>230 miles in the two days.	Since there are two trains, each train covered 230 / 2 = <<230/2=115>>115 miles. 	#### 115
Jill earns 35 x $20 = $<<35*20=700>>700 per week as a teacher.	Jill earns 15 x $30 = $<<15*30=450>>450 per week as a coach.	Jill earns a total of $700 + $450 = $<<700+450=1150>>1150 per week.	Jill earns $1150 x 50 = $<<1150*50=57500>>57500 per year.	#### 57500
In one week, Claire eats 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs.	In 4 weeks, Claire eats 21 eggs x 4 = 84 eggs.	Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Claire will eat 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.	#### 7
Marissa has already walked a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 miles.	She has 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 miles left to walk.	To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 6 / 4 = <<6/4=1.5>>1.5 hours.	Therefore, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4 miles per hour.	#### 4
The orange drink is two-thirds water, so 10 liters * (2/3) = <<10*(2/3)=6.67>>6.67 liters of water.	The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so 15 liters * (3/5) = <<15*(3/5)=9>>9 liters of water.	After spilling one liter of the orange drink, there are 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink remaining.	The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 6.67 + 9 = <<6.67+9=15.67>>15.67 liters.	#### 15.67

Billy sold 3 + 2*2 = <<3+2*2=7>>7 DVDs to his first 5 customers.	Billy didn't sell any DVDs to his last 3 customers.	Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 + 0 = <<7+0=7>>7 DVDs on Tuesday.	#### 7
The candle burns for 5 - 1 = 4 hours.	So, the candle will be 2 x 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.	#### 8
Let x be the original price of the book.	The discount is x * 25% = 0.25x.	So the discounted price is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.	Given that the discounted price is $19.50, we have 0.75x = $19.50.	Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get x = $26.	Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.	#### 26
The total cost of the milk is 5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.	The total cost of the apples is 4 x 1.50 = $<<4*1.50=6>>6.	The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is 12 + 15 + 6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.	The cost of the pizza is 50 - 33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.	So, Marie ordered 17 / 8.50 = <<17/8.50=2>>2 boxes of pizza.	#### 2
Mishka spent 3 x $16.50 = $<<3*16.50=49.50>>49.50 on shorts.	Mishka spent 3 x $22.50 = $<<3*22.50=67.50>>67.50 on pants.	Mishka spent 3 x $42 = $<<3*42=126>>126 on shoes.	Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $<<49.50+67.50+126=243>>243 on all the clothing items.	#### 243
Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream per night, so in 60 days she will eat 1 x 60 = <<1*60=60>>60 servings of ice cream.	Each carton has 15 servings, so Cynthia will need 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 cartons of ice cream.	Each carton costs $4.00, so Cynthia will spend 4 x $4.00 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00 on ice cream.	#### $16.00
Henry traveled 60 - 15 = <<60-15=45>>45 miles from his second stop to the end of the trip.	Therefore, he traveled 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 miles between his first and second stops.	#### 25
Let's call the cost of the boots B.	The cost of the first pair of heels is $33.	The cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * $33 = $66.	The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.	The cost of the boots is $99 - $5 = $94.	#### 94

Without holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.	With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, which is 400 x 3 = 1200 feet.	To hit the dragon, Polly needs to stand within 1000 feet of the dragon.	Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.	#### 200
There were a total of 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.	After the guests took their pieces, there were 40 - 14 = <<40-14=26>>26 pieces remaining.	Therefore, the guests took 40 - 26 = <<40-26=14>>14 pieces of pie.	#### 14
The bag of chips has a total of 250 x 5 = <<250*5=1250>>1250 calories.	You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left.	To find out how many grams you can eat, you need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = <<200/250=0.8>>0.8 servings.	Since there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 x 300 = <<0.8*300=240>>240 grams.	#### 240
Charlie can make 10 x 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 candles from one pound of beeswax.	The cost of supplies for 20 candles is $10.00.	He sells each candle for $2.00, so he earns 20 x $2.00 = $40.00 from selling 20 candles.	His net profit is $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00.	#### 30.00
On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, so she spent 5 * 4 = <<5*4=20>>20 hours.	On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=2>>2 more articles than on Monday.	So, she wrote a total of 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 articles on Tuesday.	This means she spent 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 hours on Tuesday.	On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.	So, she spent 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 hours on Wednesday.	Therefore, in the three days, Meredith spent a total of 20 + 28 + 56 = <<20+28+56=104>>104 hours writing articles.	#### 104
Candice started with 80 post-it notes and used 220 at work, so she used a total of 80 + 220 = <<80+220=300>>300 post-it notes.	She had 23 post-it notes remaining, so the package she purchased must have contained 300 - 23 = <<300-23=277>>277 post-it notes.	#### 277
John bought 200/40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties.	He bought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties.	The red ties cost 40 x 1.5 = $<<40*1.5=60>>60 each.	So, he spent 10 x 60 = $<<10*60=600>>600 on red ties.	Therefore, John spent a total of 200 + 600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties.	#### 800
The wire is 4 feet long, which is equal to 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 inches.	Each piece is 6 inches long, so Tracy obtained 48 / 6 = <<48/6=8>>8 pieces.	#### 8
The total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units/floor = <<15*8=120>>120 units.	3/4 of the building is occupied, so the number of occupied units is 120 units * 3/4 = <<120*3/4=90>>90 units.	The number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.	#### 30
Lloyd produces 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 dozens of eggs per day.	So, Lloyd makes 21 x 2 = $<<21*2=42>>42 per day.	Therefore, Lloyd makes 42 x 7 = $<<42*7=294>>294 per week on eggs. 	#### 294
Tom's ship travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour, so it takes him 1 hour to travel from 1 to 4 PM.	When he travels back at a rate of 6 mph, it will take him 10/6 = 1.67 hours to get back.	Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 1.67 x 60 = 100.2 minutes.	Therefore, it takes Tom approximately 100.2 minutes to get back.	#### 100.2
The weight of the comic books is 30 * 1/4 = <<30*1/4=7.5>>7.5 pounds.	So, Uriah needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5 pounds more.	Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = <<7.5/(1/2)=15>>15 toys.	#### 15
On Thursday, the mechanic earned 6 * $60 = $<<6*60=360>>360 for repairing truck tires.	On Thursday, the mechanic earned 4 * $40 = $<<4*40=160>>160 for repairing car tires.	On Friday, the mechanic earned 12 * $40 = $<<12*40=480>>480 for repairing car tires.	The mechanic earned a total of $360 + $160 = $<<360+160=520>>520 on Thursday.	The mechanic earned a total of $480 on Friday.	The mechanic earned $480 - $520 = $<<480-520=-40>>-40 more on Thursday.	#### -40

The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so the maximum weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.	Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1245 / 15 = 83.	Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.	#### 83
The delivery fee and tip amount to $3 + $4 = $7.	The 25% fee on the groceries is $40 * 0.25 = $10.	So the total extra fees are $7 + $10 = $17.	Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $40 + $17 = $57.	#### 57
The number of raspberries in the clusters is 6 clusters * 20 fruit/cluster = <<6*20=120>>120 fruit.	The total number of raspberries is 120 fruit + 67 fruit = <<120+67=187>>187 fruit.	#### 187
The total number of oranges that are not good is 1 + 20% + 2 = 1 + 0.2*25 + 2 = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8.	Therefore, the number of good oranges is 25 - 8 = 17.	#### 17
Janet pays $500 + $800 = $1300 for the brooch.	She pays $1300 x 0.10 = $130 for insurance.	Therefore, Janet pays a total of $1300 + $130 = $1430.	#### 1430
Marcy is entitled to 5% of the pension value per year, so after 30 years, she will receive 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 years of the increased pension.	The increased pension is 5/100 * 50,000 = $<<5/100*50000=2500>>2500 per year.	So, her annual pension after 30 years will be 50,000 + (10 * 2500) = $<<50000+(10*2500)=75000>>75,000.	#### 75,000
For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 x 6 = $<<140*6=840>>840.	For the second half of the year, Aleena paid $140 - ($140 x 0.10) = $140 - $14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 per month.	So, for the second half of the year, Aleena paid $126 x 6 = $<<126*6=756>>756.	Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $840 + $756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.	#### 1596
Sophia's car can travel 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas.	Therefore, Sophia's car can travel 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon of gas.	Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, Sophia can drive 25 x 12 = <<25*12=300>>300 miles on a single tank of gas.	#### 300

Tommy raises 43 x $3 = $129 from selling brownies.	Tommy raises 23 x $4 = $92 from selling cheesecakes.	Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $129 + $92 = $221.	#### 221
The total cost of the cell phones is 5 x $150 = $<<5*150=750>>750.	The interest for each unit is $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3.	So, Shiela will pay $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153 each month.	Therefore, Shiela will pay a total of $153 x 3 = $<<153*3=459>>459 for 3 months.	#### 459
Artie will make 12 * $3 + 9 * $2 + 17 * $2 = $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<12*3+9*2+17*2=100>>100.	#### 100
The square footage of each level of the sandcastle is halved compared to the level below it. So, the square footage of the second level is 16/2 = 8.	The square footage of the third level is 8/2 = 4.	The square footage of the fourth level is 4/2 = 2.	The average square footage of a level is (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5.	#### 7.5
For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need 1 cup x 180 days = <<1*180=180>>180 cups of dog food.	For the rest of the year, there are 365 days - 180 days = <<365-180=185>>185 days.	For these 185 days, Cecilia will need 2 cups x 185 days = <<2*185=370>>370 cups of dog food.	In total, Cecilia will need 180 cups + 370 cups = <<180+370=550>>550 cups of dog food in the first year.	Therefore, Cecilia will need 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = <<550/110=5>>5 bags of dog food in the first year.	#### 5
If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.	Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400/2 = <<400/2=200>>200 pounds of laundry.	The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds.	#### 100
Vincent can buy 18/3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers.	This means he would spend 6 * $2.50 = $<<6*2.5=15>>15 if he bought them in packages of 3.	Vincent can also buy 18/2 = 9 packages of 2 flowers.	This means he would spend 9 * $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9 if he bought them in packages of 2.	By buying 18 flowers at the better price, Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.	#### 6
The discount is 100 * 0.30 = $30.	So the grooming cost is 100 - 30 = $70.	#### 70
The two girls got a total of 1/6 x 24 + 1/6 x 24 = 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water.	After the boy got 6 liters, there were 24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters of water left.	#### 10
Charlie bought 10 + 21 = <<10+21=31>>31 stickers.	Charlie has 31 + 23 = <<31+23=54>>54 stickers in total.	After giving some to his sister, Charlie has 54 - 9 = <<54-9=45>>45 stickers left.	After using some for the greeting card, Charlie has 45 - 28 = <<45-28=17>>17 stickers left.	#### 17
Four times what Grace weighs is 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 pounds.	Alex weighs 500 - 2 = <<500-2=498>>498 pounds.	Their combined weight is 125 + 498 = <<125+498=623>>623 pounds.	#### 623
Dan has a total of 3 x 25 = <<3*25=75>>75 roses.	So, there are a total of 75 x 8 = <<75*8=600>>600 thorns. 	#### 600
Let's assume the number of games they lost is x.	So, the number of games they won is x + 8.	The total number of games played is x + (x + 8) = 22.	Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22.	Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14.	Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7.	Therefore, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15.	#### 15
Gene has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years.	He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has 11 x 4 = <<11*4=44>>44 quilt blocks.	#### 44
The second time the alarm went off, it rang for 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 times.	The third time the alarm went off, it rang for 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times.	In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.	#### 22
Sylvie's initial salary is $600.	The annual increase in salary is 10% of $600, which is $600 * 0.10 = $60.	After three more years of service, Sylvie will receive a total increase of $60 * 3 = $180.	Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $600 + $180 = $780.	#### 780
Let's assume Harald sold x copies.	Marilyn sold 10x copies.	So, the total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 11x.	Given that 11x = 88,000, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 11.	x = 88,000 / 11 = 8,000.	Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.	#### 8,000
The number of guests who will show up is 16 - (1/4) * 16 = 16 - 4 = 12.	Christina needs 12 * 0.75 = <<12*0.75=9>>9 gift bags.	She will spend 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 on gift bags.	#### 18
The adults will eat a total of 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 lbs of potato salad.	The children will eat a total of 5 x (10/2) = <<5*(10/2)=25>>25 lbs of potato salad.	Therefore, Ted needs to bring a total of 200 + 25 = <<200+25=225>>225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.	#### 225
Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.	Jan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets.	In total, they have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.	#### 28
If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, then Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.	If Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, then Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.	If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.	#### 4
Gerald's speed improvement is 10/100 * 38 = <<10/100*38=3.8>>3.8 seconds.	So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 - 3.8 = <<38-3.8=34.2>>34.2 seconds.	#### 34.2
The number of cats is 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120.	The number of rabbits is 120 + 60 - 12 = <<120+60-12=168>>168.	The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 120 + 60 + 168 = <<120+60+168=348>>348.	#### 348
The number of boys is 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80.	So, the number of girls is 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120.	And, the number of girls in the girl scout is 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80.	Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40.	#### 40
James slept 9 * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.	Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 more hours than James.	#### 3
The original volume of tomatoes used is 32 / 0.5 = <<32/0.5=64>>64 ounces.	Since each can contains 16 ounces, Freda used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.	Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used a total of 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 tomatoes.	#### 12
There were originally 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.	In the first 15 minutes, 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 cars drove through the traffic jam.	#### 5
Mary has a total of 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 potted plants on her window ledges.	After giving away 1 potted plant from each ledge, Mary will remain with 80 - 40 = <<80-40=40>>40 potted plants.	Mary also received 18 new potted plants, so she will have a total of 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 potted plants remaining.	#### 58
