The potential energy of the particle on the hemisphere is given by $PE = mgh$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the particle above the bottom of the hemisphere. However, in this case, the particle starts at rest on top of the hemisphere, so the height $h$ is equal to the radius $a$. Therefore, the potential energy is $PE = mgh = mga$. The kinetic energy of the particle is given by $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the speed of the particle. Since the particle starts at rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. Using the principle of conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy to the final kinetic energy: $mga = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Simplifying the equation, we get: $2a = v^2/g$. Solving for $v$, we get: $v = \sqrt{2ag}$. The angle at which the particle leaves the hemisphere can be determined using trigonometry. The vertical component of the velocity is given by $v_y = v \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle at which the particle leaves the hemisphere. At the top of the hemisphere, the vertical component of the velocity is zero, so we have: $0 = v \sin \theta$. Since $v$ is positive, this equation implies that $\sin \theta = 0$, which means that $\theta = 0$ or $\theta = \pi$.
