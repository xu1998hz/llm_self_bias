 'result in considerable hardship as the death penalty could lead to grieving, it's severe' is a major fluency/inconsistency error, as the original sentence is in Yoruba language and it's difficult to determine the intended meaning without more context. The translation seems to be an attempt to provide a paraphrased explanation rather than a direct translation. But, the provided rendering 'it's severe' is unclear and inconsistent with the context of the original sentence. A more accurate and appropriate representation could be something like 'According to the statement, the new policy would bring substantial hardship, as the application of the death penalty would cause great sorrow.' or 'According to the statement, the new policy would result in significant hardship, as the implementation of the death penalty would bring great suffering.'		-5
