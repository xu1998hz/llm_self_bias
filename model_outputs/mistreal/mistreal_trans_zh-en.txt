Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such things from happening again.
Maybe the restaurant needs more time to get ready. I can help you ask if you have the contact information.
Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting: Students Sing as Lead Actors, Research Findings Open Up New Perspectives - Xinhuanet
Yesterday evening, at the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University in 2016, a series of academic achievements that seemed to come from out of nowhere were awarded recognition. These ideas included using air to wash hands, diagnosing diseases by examining one's breath, and precisely locating sources of fog.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research spanned across fields such as environment, mechanism, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious seed, they have created many high-end inventions of practical value. Some projects have already been awarded domestically and internationally.
A biological sensor: Your family doctor at home
The research team of PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical, Medical Engineering, and Technology presented an intelligent biosensor the size of half a smartphone at the scene.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, this instrument can preliminarily detect your health status from the components of the air you exhale."
Zhang Di introduced that this sensor, connected to an intelligent phone, will display health reports after blowing out the air.
A smartwatch on the market can detect health conditions, but it usually only measures physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor applies the new material of graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect one's physical health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: The high-power eyes of doctors.
Besides smartphones, intelligent surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, this year.
Master's students Zhu Linjiao and Shulin Fei from the College of Optoelectronics and Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University started a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps, inventing an intelligent LED surgical lamp with no shadow.
"Many diseases are not diagnosed early enough or completely removed due to the lighting in the operating room of doctors."
Apil Jinfei said, for example, if a doctor cannot clearly identify all the tumor tissue during early cancer screening, cancer cells may continue to spread afterwards.
This type of intelligent surgical light has four lamp discs. The degree of contrast between different tissues under the lighting is enhanced by adjusting the light spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectral distribution, color uniformity, and imagelessness of the scan at will based on the surgical requirements and personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, among other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention received the first-place award in the National Science and Technology competition.
Using air to wash hands: water-saving and cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by using water to rinse, at most rubbing some soap and hand sanitizer. But Li Qiangzhao and his peers invented an "air-cleaning hand sanitizing device".
Standing at a soap dispenser will compress the air around us, making us lighter as soon as we weigh ourselves. (This statement is not scientifically accurate, as weight is determined by the mass of an object and the force of gravity pulling upon it, not by the amount of air compressed around it.)
"It's like blowing up a balloon."
The compressed air, when released, forms a liquid at the faucet and combines with water.
With that, we can wash our hands clean of it!
Colorimetric reactions and bacterial residue experiments have shown that this method of washing hands is just as effective as the ordinary way of washing hands.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring cleanliness and saving 90% of water in the process. The entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving, and eco-friendly.
Last year, at the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and received the only golden award.
Please arrange for the return as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points. I will not use #PRS\_ORG# again in the future!
Bones and spicy stinky tofu are not suitable for children to eat.
If it is a request to order something, please do so as soon as possible.
There isn't an answer for that question at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you about his position using the hashtag #PRS\_ORG#.
I gave up, canceled the order.
I bought it, but I wrote down the wrong address. #PRS\_ORG# refers to a specific organization or entity, but without further context it's unclear which one.
Yes, it can be changed.
Or cancel the order.
Sure, I'm here to help. Let me provide some context regarding the topic of the Chinese articles you've shared.
I find it very meaningful to have a certificate of first aid.
This is one important skills certificate besides my driving license!
Let me clarify: Emergency measures, in fact, refer to first aid procedures taken before an ambulance arrives, during a sudden emergency situation.
As is well known, there is still a significant amount of time between when an emergency occurs and when an ambulance arrives. It is during this critical time that matters most.
This is a time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or a breathing stoppage, our window of life would only be four minutes, the "golden four minutes"!
That's why knowing how to rescue those around you is so important!
When someone collapses next to us, we can use professional knowledge to perform CPR on them, instead of standing there helplessly and being unable to do anything, which is a terrifying feeling.
"In China, every year there are unexpectedly three hundred thousand deaths in our official data, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest."
Approximately 15% of the population in the United States can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70-80% can be saved, but less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is what the first-generation founder Lu Le said as a first reaction.
 if a person has had a sudden cardiac arrest and has stopped breathing, and their heartbeat has stopped, giving them chest compressions will have no effect.
It is only through artificial respiration and external compressions that a person can be revived.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid these days. But in case of an emergency, it's too late. I would like to urge everyone to learn this skill. By doing so, we can react in a timely manner when faced with unexpected situations.
Perhaps it can even save a person's life!
You can register for first aid training at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts as well.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25. Adding an emergency certificate to the list of goals was also something I did a few months ago, and I actually accomplished it!
I'm going to take other certifications next, I plan to take a scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a scuba diving first aid certification, it seems like you need to have the first aid certification to take the scuba diving certification exam, so in fact, the first aid certification is quite useful!
I have ordered #Number#
One 13 yuan shui zhu shui jiao (steamed shrimp dumpling) only?
I haven't tried that.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
One costs 13 yuan? I'm unable to understand this question in its current form as it seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide more context or clarify the question?
Yesterday, #PRS\_ORG# accidentally sent me food, and now it's only giving me a shrimp dumpling?！？
Because I saw that the code I entered before was effective.
First, I'd like to state my personal opinion that the movie "Four Seas" is a complete flop from all aspects.
Although you may say that this movie is not a highlight, at least the background music selection is quite good.
A badge of many kinds, one that makes you drowsy and comfortable in the cinema, another that makes you angry and filled with righteous indignation after watching it, the movie "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Huangshan for audiences. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is indeed a pure talent in terms of disrespecting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a fabricated work in the style of a Chekhov novel, with an unclear identity and numerous loopholes, just like a cheap denim jacket on a Small Soldier character.
After watching it, you may even suspect that there are hidden metaphors in it by the director. But after careful thought, you'll find out that it's just a pile of manure.
Let me first explain some parts that I have difficulty understanding.
The main character's place of residence should be a Southern island, and he should be closely dependent on his grandma.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so a neighbor, who was a kind old man, offered to take her on his small bakery cart to the northeast to fulfill her wish. The scene was arranged accordingly in the plot.
An elderly person observing snow from a bread wagon, traveling from the south to the northeast? It seems unlikely as bread wagons have been largely replaced by more modern forms of transport, and it's an unusual mode of transportation for a long-distance journey. The context of this statement is unclear without additional information.
He and his father are quite reassured about this.
Then this old man had no more text left.
Opening a restaurant on an abandoned cargo ship, how did the female lead and her brother obtain the business license? This question seemingly relates to a specific plot in a movie or a story and I would need more context to provide a satisfactory answer. If you could provide the title or the name of the work, it would be helpful. In general, the procedures and requirements for obtaining a business license can vary depending on the industry, location, and specific regulations, so it would need to be addressed case by case.
Why can the rowdy members of the "Island Planes Party" easily block a mountain path with just a few planes?
Then a cement truck right in the middle of the road came to a halt, and the drivers of all the surrounding trucks couldn't find any steel bars (implying that the cement truck was stuck without steel bars).
This tool's function is quite obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small thug with a poor credit record and suspicion of law violations become a police auxiliary?
In the face of high-interest loans, why didn't the police report it in reality, and why did the cops even ask if there were any difficult situations in the movie?
A grown-up person who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room keycard in a hotel, then arranges for someone to find the hotel manager who's not available, and ends up sleeping outside the room?
The whole movie is filled with bizarre situations that make no sense. Recalling them brings me sadness due to their implausibility.
Excluding the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or to put it bluntly, the movie has no theme at all, just a Frankenstein monster of a production.
At the beginning of the movie, you may think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational movie. Midway through, you think it's about the difficult lives of small-town young people, but when you finish watching it, you're left in deep reflection, wondering why you went to the cinema during New Year's Day to watch something irrelevant.
For most people, these movie plots are quite familiar. For instance, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle mechanic, you'll begin with an inspirational and comic episode, then tell the audience about an untalented novice who gradually achieves success.
If you want to shoot a love story, you'd better stick to the romantic entanglements of a young man from the old town who loves motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least the plot in your story shouldn't contradict the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new motorcycle owner who was burnt but still managed to sing in Xin Yanzi's play), it is better not to come up with ideas that are as clichéd as those that even Khan Noonien Singh would find weak.
As for the female lead, who was clearly not slow-witted, but acted like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I don't know if it was intentional acting or the director's requirement.
I still don't quite understand one thing: Why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so eager to add racing collision scenes in his own movies?
Arranging such a movie in the Chinese New Year film lineup, is it to block the audience's enjoyment?

Inspecting concrete modules production and processing Equipment for wellLiners in Zhengzhou: Introduction of Well Liner Module Production Equipment.
Zhengzhou Yixin is a domestic brick machine manufacturer for precast concrete pit modules, pit masonry machinery, and wall body module machinery. They produce from semi-automatic to fully automated production lines.
Through years of practice and development, we now have extensive capabilities, mainly in producing high-quality, hydraulic, mobile, and fully automated checkwell series equipment and accessories.
Checking the production and processing equipment for precast concrete modules for well linings at the Zhengzhou well lining precast concrete module assembly site:
Checking the production and processing equipment for concrete modules of well linings in Zhengzhou: Characteristics and advantages of the well lining concrete module production and processing equipment.
The new-type building material made of coal, heat, water, electricity, and gas infrastructure sub-structure blocks from Yishan inspection can be widely applied to the construction of municipal public works.
For example: irrigation and water storage facilities such as check wells, rainwater gutters, ditches, sewage pools, and small structures like bridge abutments.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build check wells is that all sides of the module have recessed structures, enabling them to be assembled into a chain-link structure through stacking and laying.
The masonry formed by pressing against the side of a well or an embankment has greater compressive strength than the plane masonry formed by simple pressing.
This passage describes a hollow module structure with vertical通通 (communicating) and horizontal贯贯 (interconnected) holes. After the holes are filled with concrete, a reinforced concrete network structure is formed, which has a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module has cross and longitudinal reinforcing bars set at regular intervals, which increase the overall strength of the structure by responding to the horizontal and vertical loads.
Additionally, the use of reinforced concrete check well modules for constructing check wells and drainage wells makes it difficult for them to collapse, sink, or leak. The mechanical properties of the wall and modules are stable, and the operation is simple with standardized sizes.
The intelligent control system for the concrete checking well module brick machine equipment has a one-key touch screen monitor for data input and output, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of materials, density control, safety logical control, and fault diagnosis systems.
The well lining and wall module mechanical hydraulic system uses single cylinder hydraulic and transmission, as well as double cylinder hydraulic and transmission.
An independent compressed gas station ensures the reliability of the compressed gas system by avoiding the influence of the host's vibration.
The concrete checking well module brick machine equipment cabinet is lifted up during the demolding process. The cargo box with a self-closing door, automatic transfer pallet, and the entire process is controlled by an independent hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
Concrete testing well module brick machines and equipment use import computers and electronics, sealed valves and hydraulic components, with comprehensive performance stability and reliability.
The mechanical vibration platform for concrete module filling uses integral steel plates for the wall and foundation, with the cutting lines of the mold being smooth without welding points. This allows the filling box to move freely in the direction of the vibration, significantly reducing mechanical wear.
Reducing the load on molds, filling in the blank areas, and integrating vibration amplitude for one-body and synchronized vibration, ensuring the effect of real vibration is achieved. (This passage seems to be describing a technical process related to machinery or engineering, but it is not clear from the given information alone what exactly is being described.)
A vibration mechanism for concrete formwork with mechanical and computer automated control, adjusting the amplitude based on the material cost-performance to minimize wear and tear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The masonry module of the well wall has both mechanical automatic control and manual control functions.

Chongqing Middle College trials modern apprenticeship system, enrolled students as enterprise employees upon admission - Xinhuanet
Yesterday, a reporter learned from the city's education commission that starting this year, our city will trial the "modern apprenticeship system" talent training mode in 60 technical schools. Students who participate in trial training will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and will be pre-registered as employees by trial enterprise units after enrollment.
The municipal education commission requiresthe regularization of recruitment and enrollment procedures in junior colleges, clarifying the dual identity of apprentices as both students of junior colleges and employees of enterprises. Three-party agreements are to be signed between apprentices, schools, and enterprises based on the principles of mutual selection. For apprentices who have not reached the age of 18, a four-party agreement must be signed between the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise, outlining each party's rights and responsibilities, as well as the specific on-the-job training position, teaching content, and wage guarantees for the apprentice.
Encouraging trial schools to cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment and on-the-job training for students using the apprenticeship system.
Experimental schools need to reform talent training modes.
Schools and enterprises design talent training plans together, jointly establish professional teaching and course standards, job standards, company instructor standards, and quality monitoring standards, as well as relevant implementation plans.
A trial model involves training talent through educational institutions for a certain period. The internship duration for students in enterprises is determined based on professional talent cultivation plans. Top-level internships generally last for 6 months.
In enterprises, implement the team-based management mode for training, with one master craftsman training 2-5 apprentices in each smaller learning group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each training post.
According to the arrangements, our city identified 60 municipal-level vocational and technical apprenticeship pilot projects starting from 2016, with each project having around 50 students, totaling around 3,000 students (apprentices) in all.
According to the principle of "pilot first and then expand," explore the establishment of a sustainable mechanism for joint recruiting, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation between schools and enterprises. This will effectively improve students' job skills, increase the employment rate and quality for graduates.

This vacuum cleaner was considered thoroughly before purchase, and though it was difficult to make the decision, its suction performance is not bad. The dust at home has noticeably decreased, but it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand. The wet-dry function needs improvement, and there will be dust trails when removing it; overall, I am quite satisfied with it.
The electric stove is quite deep, looks sophisticated, fits me well as a kitchen novice, my child says it tastes better than what I cook, I have made a main course and a side dish, and the sweet and sour pork is particularly delicious. After a long time, it doesn't take much time to use, and it doesn't make much noise, I don't have to worry about burning it or not being able to make it.
Receiving the delivery in the afternoon, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes right away! Technology really changes our lives, the stove's temperature and seasoning control is **precise**, and the texture of the dishes directly upgrades to chef-level quality. It's a godsend for those who are not good at cooking! I highly recommend purchasing this!
I have added a new member to my kitchen.
An intelligent cooking machine, one that automatically controls the temperature and flips food over.
You no longer have to be afraid of getting burnt by hot oil, or losing control of the heat and burning the food or overcooking it.

China Children's Center to Hold Series of Activities to Help Children "High-tech" Celebrate "Six-one" - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20 (Yellow Xiaoxi and Zhuchanhan): On May 28, the China Children's Center informed Xinhua News Agency reporters that the China Children's Center plans to hold a series of activities, including "Children's Creator Experience," "Children's Visual Art Festival," and "Children's Literary and Arts Gala," before and after Children's Day on June 1, to let children experience the charm of frontier science and technology and enjoy the "Children's Day."
According to the information I have obtained, China Children's Center will hold activities for the "Children's Day" festival this year, including the "Love Home Creative Festival" for children's future learning, the first Children's Visual Art Festival, the "Literature and Arts festival", and the "Whole Family Reading" illustrated book series activities, among others.
Deputy Director Li Zhongming of the China Children's Center introduced at the "Double Five" Children's Day Media Press Conference held on the 20th that "Love Home Cool" is the main activity of the China Children's Center to celebrate "Children's Day" in 2016.
Focusing on integrating social innovation with family personal creativity, by enabling children and families to participate in various innovative educational activities, and making practical innovation a cultural gene for the masses, with "do-it-yourself" becoming a new learning and living style for many families.
According to the reports, the "Love Home Cool" Children's Future Learning Carnival organized by "Dougou Chuangke" includes "Bean Sprout Creator" experiential activities, the first anniversary celebration of the "Cow Children's Exploration Museum," the "VR All-People Experience Plan," and "Creator Town" interactive workshops, among dozens of cutting-edge technology experiential contents.
Sauteed five-spice pork changes into boiled five-spice pork with mustard greens.
It's possible that you'll need to buy a considerable amount, say $100 or $200, to use it.
People are concerned, just how long will it take to complete [something]?
Sure, I'll help you! One way to find talent for rural revitalization is to attract and bring back outstanding rural migrant workers. These workers have gained skills and knowledge from working in urban areas, and by returning to their rural hometowns, they can use their abilities to contribute to the development and modernization of their communities. This approach not only benefits the rural areas, but also provides opportunities for the returnees to fulfill their dreams of contributing to their communities while living a better quality of life with lower living costs. This strategy is in line with China's rural revitalization plan to promote the integrated development of urban and rural areas.
Is it the same rider who is delivering it to me?

A South African Doctor: The spreading power of Omicron is strong, but it is mainly for mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, but its transmission speed is faster.
According to a report by Reuters, in KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, with symptoms such as body pain and cough, which are similar to flu symptoms.
The managing director of this organization, Dr. An Ben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pelé said: "They can control the diseases at home, and most of them recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said, this includes the elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions, who are more likely to develop severe conditions from the coronavirus infection.
He said that in comparison to the previous Delta wave of the epidemic, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing, with low oxygen levels."
Many people will have to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of an Omicron variant infectious disease in the southern part of Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the severe illness rate from the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the mortality rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports to say: "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said: "We still need to obtain late-stage data at this stage."
"Generally speaking, the onset of hospitalization and death occurs later in most cases. However, in this wave of the epidemic, we have only entered the two-week mark."
At the same time, scientists from all over the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta being the main COVID-19 strain in the world, cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in over 50 countries, with South Africa being a center for the outbreak.
According to health officers, the number of new cases found in Heilong Province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and over 90% of the confirmed cases were caused by the Omicron variant.
I appreciate today's supporters. All 80 boxes have been sent out!

Commentary on Education: How can we save kidnapped children?
If we make a comparison with the famous philanthropic slogan "No trading, no killing," in a good environment where there is no demand for "kidnapping," collective prevention and public intervention, making kidnapping unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes would be less likely to occur repeatedly.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Public Security Department launched an urgent missing children information publishing platform online.
This is an authoritative platform for the publication of children's missing information, and a timely platform for rescuing abducted children on the internet.
I have heard that the name of this app is "Tuan Yuan". I feel a very warm feeling towards it.
New technological methods are not only named "culture and arts," full of emotion, but also effectively utilized through information technology.
The primary goal of anti-kidnapping enforcement is to recover kidnapped children and ensure their physical safety and freedom.
Next is the judging and punishing of the suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment can be explained through various "grand terms" such as individual punishment, social prevention, and legal education.
Before cases of human trafficking are exposed, priority should be given to ensuring the physical safety of the victims.
Topics such as "should child trafficking be punished with the death penalty?" which are controversial and contentious, can be put on hold for now in our urgent quest for rescue. However, there is no time to waste when it comes to assisting children who have been trafficked.
Based on the experience of investigating similar cases, human traffickers are accustomed to departing from the scene of the crime as soon as they have seized their victims.
Investigating a kidnapping case even for a moment longer can make the child take a step further away from their parents, and the difficulty of solving the case increases.
Given the situation, taking out tools such as the "Reunion" platform, which effectively helps in solving cases and finding children, is indeed a practical action.
Indeed, "kidnapping" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to be put in place to handle it properly.
Combating crimes, safeguarding the rights of children and parents, from the perfection of laws to the protection of the judiciary, as well as the meticulous enforcement, all require the care and implementation of the "Protecting and Assisting the Weak" policy.
Apart from this, the prevention of child trafficking can still be improved from the family level to the societal level.
For example, a common case is that a family of three, including parents and a child, falls asleep while resting at the train station and awakens to find the child missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a sufficient protective consciousness.
Both parents taking turns to rest or placing children in a secure environment are the minimum measures for preventing child abduction.
From the perspective of law enforcement against human trafficking, the purchasing side of child trafficking also deserves attention and punishment.
A single act of lawlessness is often just a link in a long chain.
According to the stipulations of China's Criminal Law, the sentencing for child trafficking starts at five years; for particularly serious cases, the punishment can be capital punishment, and property confiscation is also applied.
With high penalties for release and the most severe punishments, child trafficking crimes obviously belong to the category of crimes with heavier penalties, in the trend of "leniency in sentencing" (轻刑化).
There are still quite a few cases of trafficking occurring each year.
It is evident that some people have outdated notions regarding raising children and weak legal consciousness.
Legal education for this group of people should keep pace.
Effective control of human trafficking crimes cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" for abduction is widespread, the abductors' greed will be fanned, leading them to continually innovate abduction methods, resulting in a confrontational situation with enforcers. Abduction activities are likely to become ineffective and mired in low productivity.
Therefore, eliminating outdated notions and promoting legal awareness can help eradicate child trafficking and Child purchasing crimes.

Draw inspiration from the Party's 100-yearstruggle.

Actually, I don't know if it was the shop that made a mistake or the rider.
The bag does not have a receipt.
Can't be traced.
I hope you understand now.
Because the delivery time is 30 minutes faster than shown.
Never mind, thank you.
Yes, a new rider has come.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always said they are still processing.
I waited for a few hours.
The International Olive Oil Council classifies olive oil into two major categories: Virgin Olive Oil (VOO) and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil (ROO), with five levels each.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold pressing fresh olives and filtered to remove impurities.
Based on acidity levels, we can divide them into three categories:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Top-grade first cold-pressed): It is the highest level, high-quality olive oil, and is a completely natural product.
The flavor is excellent, with a subtle and refreshing aroma of plants and an acidity level not exceeding 1%.
High-quality virgin olive oil: Acidity is slightly elevated, not more than 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Cold-pressed Olive Oil: The taste and aroma are still acceptable, with an acidity level not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to olive oil obtained by refining raw olive oil with an acidity level above 3.3%. It is often referred to as "secondary oil."
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Refined olive oil is made by blending it with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance its taste and color. The acidity level is below 1.5%, and it appears in a translucent, faint yellow color.
Refined olive-pomace oil, also known as olive-pomace oil, is extracted from olive pulp residue through a solvent extraction method and then refined.
Those who have seen the rankings should have discovered that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
Coconuts are like grapes for making wine. The quality of the coconut oil depends on the origin and variety of the coconuts.
The best growing place for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for olive cultivation, including the right temperature, sunlight hours, humidity, and rainfall.
Excluding the coasts of the South China Sea, other regions can only scatter plant talent in suitable areas.
The main producing areas and bases (Mediterranean regions):
Countries such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Argentina in the southern latitudes with similar climates.
The olive harvest month:
Every year, between March and June, is the season for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, turning from green to purple, then black.
The harvest season for fruits is from November to the second month of the next year (the freshness of olive oil is quite important).
The nutritional components of olive oil:
 Olive oil contains abundant monounsaturated fatty acids, specifically oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
 Olive oil is considered the most suitable edible oil for the human body among those discovered so far.
The Democratic Summit came to a close, with Biden stating that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online "Summit for Democracy" hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden came to a close on Friday, December 10, with the participation of over 110 countries' government leaders, civil society, and private sector representatives.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and despotic regimes can never extinguish it.
He also mentioned that the plan is to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
A representative of the Taiwan government and a member of its administrative committee, Tang Feng, and a Hong Kong democratic activist and asylum seeker in the UK, Luo Guansong, spoke at the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know the task in front of us is how immense."
But we also know that we can meet the challenges because, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is present everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flames of freedom that burn in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also stressed that safeguarding democracy requires the efforts of the entire society.
He said: "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the democratic safeguards, promote reform, and achieve transparent accountability. This would make us more capable of countering the buffeting and shock forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who selfishly seek power at the expense of public interest."
The themes for the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are to defend human rights, consolidate democracy against authoritarianism, counter digital authoritarianism, and affirm democratic values.
This day happens to coincide with "International Human Rights Day" [
Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres also stated in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges on a global scale, particularly the challenges brought about by emerging digital technology.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values, positions, and democratic resilience."
This requires deepening social dialogue, solving inequities, fighting corruption, updating social contracts, and investing in quality education, as well as expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It is necessary to sternly denounce all forms of chauvinism, localism, and extremism, including those using tools provided by technological revolutions.
Democratic figure in Hong Kong, Lo Tak-shing, delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue paying attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and other ethnic minorities such as Uighurs and Tibetans in China.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
That's why political figures and leaders from civil society must cooperate.
We must utilize all of our resources to ensure the democratic revival is our top priority.
Robert O'Brien also called on the free world to unite and resist the threats from the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the CCP, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you have not realized the threat the CCP poses to our democratic values."
That's the reason for our failure.
That's also the reason we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values," Taiwan Executive Yuan Administrative Yuan Commissioner Tang Fei attended and released the statement "National Declaration" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of opposing authoritarianism and despotism.
He also shared his experiences on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through transparency in information and building trust.
He said: "In the context of democracy and freedom's flourishing in Taiwan, we have always remained firm in sticking to the front line of opposing authoritarianism in the global arena, and have taken on a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments at various places, in the name of public health and collective interests, have reasonably infringed upon human rights. The reversing signs of global democracy are notable.
" however, in Taiwan, we don't have to impose a blockade to control the epidemic, or take down information to win against disinformation."
On the second day of the schedule at the "Democratic Summit," the US Treasury Department announced that it was implementing sanctions according to the law against 15 individuals and 10 entities of China, North Korea, and other countries that have been identified as seriously violating human rights. At the same time, it imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
I have already taken a photo and uploaded it for you.
I know, but I cannot provide an answer to that in the given context. The Chinese phrase "我知道呀" translates to "I know, OK." It's often used in casual conversations to acknowledge that one is aware of the situation but may not have a solution or answer.
The restaurant keeps delaying the delivery time, but I don't know why.
Originally, #NUMBER# was required.
Well, in response to the previous question, I would say:
I'm sorry, the previous Chinese text was about rural revitalization and talent. The new Chinese text "不吃了" means "I'm not eating anymore" or "I can't eat any longer".
I will definitely file a complaint.
You couldn't send it, so why didn't you say earlier?
"You've been waiting for so long"
I haven't received a call.
Please have him sent to our company again.
I don't want to wait another #NUMBER# minutes.
I waited at a restaurant for half an hour.
The "#PRS\_ORG#" has not been sent yet.
I'd like to cancel my order.
Why not cancel it? (This question doesn't make much sense without additional context.)
Hello, the dried chicken given by the restaurant is really alive?
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't persist, so I'd like to find a trainer with a similar fee first.
Unfriendly tip: In reality, the price is usually proportional to the friendliness, so if you can't discern, the expensive gear is usually more friendly than the cheap one. Those "entry-level cameras" in this category are industrial trash.
They have low strength, the ball bounces very high when struck, vibrating greatly. Hard balls cannot withstand it, even skilled players find it hard to control.
The implicit logic and subtext is: "Tennis is so difficult, I know you can't master it and you won't want to spend a lot, so I'll sell you a cheap and inferior racket. After playing it for a few times, you will no longer want to play it. In this way, this racket is cheap, and you don't have to feel bad about it."
"If you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. When you come here again to buy the expensive stuff, I will make money twice over."
I suggest buying a second-hand decent tennis racket for around the same price as a new one. Brands like Prince or Dunlop are recommended as they are not too famous, so good quality rackets do not command high prices. New rackets cost around 500-600 yuan, while you can find a good second-hand one for only 200 yuan. Isn't it enjoyable to own a tennis racket worth thousands of yuan at a fraction of the cost?
Being friendly to newcomers but becoming irrelevant after the novice stage, but most people, especially women, can't get past the novice stage.
The order delivery time has been delayed multiple times.
Sure, I can help you with that. Let me look into it further.
Delay
You're welcome!
It means "Have I already had credits (or points)"? In Chinese credit system, you earn points when you make transactions or complete tasks. The usage here is not clear without more context.
Next, do I need to place a new order again? It seems that order shouldn't be cared about anymore?
Hello, the meal I ordered from this restaurant was incomplete when it arrived, and the rooster I ordered was still alive.
#PRS\_ORG# Please cancel the unnecessary request for me to pick it up.
My order was to have the goods delivered, not for self-pickup.
Jiangxi to train 100,000 rural primary school physical education and music teachers in the next three years - Xinhuanet
Xinhua Report from Nanchang (Reporter Chen Yushan): Recently, I learned from the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department that since 2016, in order to enhance the ability to guarantee the rural teaching force and promote the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, Jiangxi Province plans to train one qualified music, art, and physical education teacher for each elementary school in towns and villages (below that level) within three years. This totals 10,000 teachers.
According to the information I have, the training objects for this time are teachers from primary schools in Jiangxi Province who are 45 years old or younger, have a foundation or ability in music, arts, or physical education, and are able to teach other subjects as well as music, arts, or physical education courses.
Through training, we can help them master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of arts and music education, update teaching concepts and attitudes, learn modern teaching methods, improve their ability to teach scientifically and effectively, design activities, develop campus culture, and enhance their self-development abilities. Building a team of specialized and versatile arts and music teachers, we can alleviate the shortage of rural arts and music teachers.
In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi plans to have one trainer for every 100 primary schools in each county (city, district), totaling 300 trainers, who will be fully equipped with teaching demonstration and leading abilities, training activity design and organization abilities, training capabilities, and network training workshop building abilities. They will act as teachers, demonstrators, instructors, and supervisors.
Because waiting another 20 minutes means you have already waited for an hour (1 hour = 60 minutes). #NUMBER# refers to the number that is equal to 60 and is represented in minutes (e.g., 100 minutes = 1 hour and 40 minutes = 100 minutes). In this context, it indicates that waiting for 20 more minutes will add an hour to the total waiting time.
I don't want food that was made just an hour ago.
I have found the customer for the erroneous order that I made earlier.
But I can't find my wheel cakes anymore. (Wheel cakes, also known as "car roulette cakes," are a type of traditional Chinese pastry often sold by street vendors.)

Hello, how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
They have already completed their work.
Your jockey's phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, name is #NAME#.

OK, if there really isn't any, then just refund the payment for the restaurant order.
In fact, for overweight girls, the choice of clothes and coordination is particularly important.
A plump girl's skirt should not be too short or too long, the length should be around the knees, just long enough to cover the wider parts of her thighs.
A short skirt will reveal the thickness of one's legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a dwarfish and obese feeling.
Wearing different colors for the upper, lower, and lower leg parts will make one look taller if you imagine dividing the body into three parts. The top, skirt, and long socks will create a sense of elegance and length. (Note: This statement is more related to fashion advice than anything else.)
In fact, many dark-colored outfits are staples for overweight women (the author has a lot of experience with this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide one's body weight, and high-class and elegant black miniskirts are a favorite among overweight women.
Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make you look thinner.
If your calves are quite fat, try not to wear socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more mass-market it is, the better, it shouldn't be too colorful.
This ensures that people pay attention to your calves and feet, making them feel plump.
For slightly chubby little girls, there are some fashion tips for dressing up properly.
A plump girl should not wear tight-fitting short skirts. The top should not be too short or tucked in, which will make people uncomfortable. if she has thick thighs, she should wear black long stockings or fishnet stockings (the fine ones), and choose soft printed pencil skirts. A blouse with a loose collar can effectively hide her shortcomings.
Of course, a girl who is a bit plump can still pay attention to what she wears when wearing a miniskirt.
A girl with a full figure should choose an upper garment in the same color as her short skirt, which can create the effect of making her figure look longer and more proportionate.
Wearing a skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest combination in the summer!
If you are an "MM" with a heavy upper body but skinny legs, I recommend choosing a beautiful flowing maxi skirt.
Not only can it cover up flaws, but it can also showcase your strengths. (This is likely spoken about something, such as clothing or an ability, that can make people more confident.)
An A-line skirt will make one look quite slim, it is more suitable for plump women. The upper part should be selected to be more fitting, creating a layered effect that makes one look even slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with shorts can be tried even by plump MM.
A chubby girl can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as the rules of dressing up are mastered well, plump girls will also become the attention-grabbing focus of the crowd.
After changing my clothing style, in life I should also exercise more to strive to shed the "petite woman" label before dawn. lol.

Girl acts as target for her sister's fundraising: "I'm okay with being a meat shield" - Xinhuanet
At Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday in the morning, a photo of a "Girl from Hangzhou volunteering to be the 'target' for her sister's fundraising" went viral on social media.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board in Wuling Square, Hangzhou, with the words "Human Target, One Arrow for Ten Yuan" written on it, suggesting that people pay ten yuan to shoot arrows at her.
This behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, an official in charge of propaganda for the Xiacheng District Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City confirmed to Xinjingbao Reporters that the girl in question was indeed provoked by her sister when she staged such enthusiastic actions for fundraising. However, such behavior is not worth promoting. After being rebuked, the girl had already left the local police station by yesterday.
A girl who set up a "target" on the street for donations was reprimanded.
A viral photo shows a long-haired girl forming the shape of the Chinese character "个" (one) while standing in front of a large wooden board. The board bears the inscription "human target, ten yuan per arrow" in black ink. Another wooden board next to her has her bank account number and her WeChat, Alipay accounts written on it.
This picture has caused controversy after it was posted online.
Some web users consider this action as "attention-grabbing begging behavior," and there are many web users who sympathize with it.
"We found out about this situation around 10 o'clock in the morning of the 23rd. There were already quite a few onlookers gathering around."
The police officer at the scene of the incident in Tianshui said that there were two girls selling things, both around 20 years old, and they were dressed neatly and youthfully.
Among them, a girl who was acting as a "human target" in the game kept crying and asked passersby to play the game with her; another girl was shouting from the side, saying that her friend's older sister had white blood disease and urgently needed surgery fees, please help.
"We have contacted the local public security authorities in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, a publicity official at the Xiacheng District Police Station of Hangzhou City told a reporter from Xinjingbao that this girl is named Jia Li, and she is raising funds for her sister Jia Lian.
However, since treatment requires over 30 thousand yuan, she was temporarily at a loss as to how to raise funds and thus resorted to this behavior.
He said, throughout the entire process, one girl acted as the target, while the other was responsible for pulling the bow, but neither of them participated directly, and no one was seen shooting arrows. People only gathered around to observe and took photos, which were later posted on Weibo.
The Public Security Department of the Police under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice identified that the bows and arrows used were not within the scope of regulation.
The person in charge stated, "We do not advocate for this sensationalistic fundraising method."
After being warned by the dispatched officer, she left the police station.
The heat dissipation effect is good. Lightweight and easy to carry. I am satisfied with the appearance materials. The macroscopic price-performance ratio of Macro is quite high.
New machines are very good.
Stable performance, handling four hotspots effectively, and worth recommending.
This Huawei Dark Knight Dragon game is quite good. The workmanship and materials are reliable, and the brand is trustworthy.
The price of Huawei's Mate 40 is not considered high in the market.
In my opinion, the Dark Knight on Dragonrider from the MMO "Aion" is great. The game feel is comfortable, I can enjoy most games smoothly, the frame rate of eating chicken is stable and high, **and CS:GO is also easily conquered**, not to mention that most 3A games can be handled well.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is not bad, the fan is quite powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect with the fan on full power is still not small.
Appearance and material: The appearance is quite cool and stylish, the game's wind effects are already attractive. Display effect: The screen is very clear and 1080p resolution is enough.
I bought a notebook that turned out to be quite satisfactory. I primarily use it for designing, and considering its price, it's surprisingly light and good-looking. The red color on the back is an attractive shade of wine red, not as flashy as one might imagine. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I think it would also suits girls well.
I started contacting Macrobase Darknight Riders two years ago. After using them for two years, the cost-benefit ratio is quite high, and the quality is excellent!

In a popular article titled "Quick Look! Project Managers Who Can Outshine Gold Medalists in Projects," it was mentioned that project managers play crucial roles in numerous projects, often leading the way with no one able to rival them. Their daily routine includes tasks such as carrying bricks, traveling, and working late into the night. Yet, their responsibilities extend to putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing.
Although it may appear as casual banter in the article, it also reveals the daily frustrations and disenchantment of project managers, reflecting a lack of heart in current project management work.
Employees engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to break free from the predicament in their work through some actions.
From the increasing number of enrollees in PMP (certified professionals in project management) every year, it can be seen that more and more project management personnel are enhancing their capabilities through learning.
According to the "China Project Management Twentieth Anniversary Development Report (1999-2019)": as of September 2019, the total number of people who have registered for PMP® certification in China reached nearly 600,000 times, and the number of people who have passed the certification exam was approximately 42,000, with an effective certification holders of around 30,000 people. This accounts for about 31.2% of the global total of PMP® certified persons.
In the past 10 years, the number of people holding PMP certificates has increased annually, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that relying on simple copying of past "experience" is no longer effective. The rapidly changing work environment tells us that we must learn and discover the path forward by standing on the shoulders of scientific giants.
While having a PMP certification may help in project management work, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a smooth workflow.
Many project management beginners say that by learning PMP/IPMP and related courses, they can systematically master the ten domains and five process groups related to project management, but when they actually engage in project management work, they are still in a state of confusion.
Many project managers often raise the following issues: Their understanding of project management is not sufficient, they merely rely on personal experience and lack project management theories and practices, there is a lack of Systematic project management process supportive institutions in their work, project estimates are not accurate, control and sensitivity are insufficient, and projects are constantly delayed; team roles are unclear, team members, named "old hands," are difficult to handle, communication between departments is not smooth, and projects have difficulty advancing ...
For over a decade, focusing on product innovation and development management, they have helped numerous excellent enterprises cultivate batches of product managers, project managers, and other key talent in R&D, and have been honored as "Demonstration Base for Corporate R&D Talent Training in China" by the China Association for Science and Technology. Zentian Consulting brings with them the "Product Project Manager Professional Training Camp" online course.
The "Research Project Manager Special Training Camp" is an online course that combines practical cases, tools, and methods from various research-type enterprises to help you master essential knowledge and standard actions of a project manager and advance on your own project management path.

The course is not just taught by the Zhongtian Huaxia Expert Team (originally from Huawei's research and development management team), but also incorporates advanced project management methodologies from international leading projects and real business scenarios from well-known enterprises to provide both in-depth and shallow professional explanations of the course content. (Peer reviews from other students may be checked to back up the claims)
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich templates and forms, to help students apply their learning to specific work after class.

Jitexin calls on consumers for rational spending before "Double 12" - Jingji Guancha (Economic Observer) - Professional financial news website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival online transaction business amounted to 1.77 trillion yuan, reaching a new high compared to previous years.
Colorful discount coupons and live broadcast e-commerce once again attracted consumers with great benefits, marveling at the growing consumer power of the populace, but at the same time forcing us to calmly consider the impact of consumerism on society and the current mainstream consumer group.
Before the arrival of the "Double Twelfth" festival, Jitexin Consumer Financing Company (hereinafter referred to as "Jitexin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding all users, particularly the young, to establish good consumption consciousness and habits, and to reject mindless consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, which is 2.04 points higher than in 2019.
Overall, Chinese residents have shown good performance in financial consumption, but there are significant disparities in financial behavior and skills. We need to further improve the basic financial literacy level.
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and young are relatively low. The "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education. The report issued by Nelson on the debt status of Chinese young people and the report on Chinese youth consumption released by China Central Television Finance and Economics show that young people have great consumption potential. Credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and about half of them do not have accumulated debts. Young people generally exhibit rational consumption trends, but they are different from the label of "excessive spending" attached to them. Some young people indeed have excessive consumption and following trends, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risk, even causing social problems to gradually increase. Financial enterprises should take on social responsibility and guide positively.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Jetech has always been dedicated to providing quality and caring services to help people build their own happy lives, promoting consumers in adopting good and correct consumption attitudes, and actively responding to regulatory calls by taking practical actions to elevate consumers, especially the younger generation, in terms of rational consumption awareness.
Over the past few years, Jietong has conducted comprehensive and diverse financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth, including college students, through cooperating with top-level domestic universities to launch innovation and practice competitions and other forms. This has subtly guided their consumption needs, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, and enabling them to plan and meet their consumption demands. Ultimately, this supports them in accumulating wealth for their lives.
Just before the Twelfth Day, Jitexin reminds all consumers to cultivate a rational consumption consciousness and correct financial viewpoint, resist blind and excessive consumption, avoid consumer credit pitfalls, and prevent adverse effects on personal credit ratings and future economic lives.
It is necessary to plan consumption in advance and repay on time based on your ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual credit report. It may have a negative impact on future car purchases, housing purchases, and other economic and living matters.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, choose regular institutions and channels, and remember to check if the relevant institutions have the necessary business qualifications.
In the future, Jitetianbao will continue to rely on its mature, reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to bring more tailored and diverse services to consumers. It will continue to help consumers enhance their financial literacy, cultivate rational consumption and moderate borrowing concepts, and become a trustworthy lifetime financial services partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Voice: The Hong Kong and Macao Cooperation Committee responds to common challenges - Vietnam People's Voice website
Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, has stopover stations in Amman, Jordan; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); Qatar; and Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit by the Saudi Crown Prince to Qatar since the diplomatic crisis erupted between Saudi Arabia and its Arab League allies against Qatar in the middle of 2017, leading to a Gulf crisis and a threat to Gulf diplomacy.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed diplomatic ties and imposed a comprehensive embargo on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having close relations with Iran.
Tensions in diplomacy severely affected the unity of the Haikou Exhibition and Conference, bringing negative impacts on the economy of the relevant region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was resolved at the Haweel Cooperation Commission Summit in January 2021. Various Haweel country representatives signed a protocol towards "Unity and Stability" brokered by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are restoring relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors from both countries, the first step since the diplomatic crisis.
The Gulf countries' normalization of differences with Qatar stems from the requirement of unity for the interests and regional stability of all countries, with the aim of addressing common challenges.
During this visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the neighboring countries through two Gulf harbors.
A connection spanning over 725 kilometers between the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will invest $50 billion in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and both countries' enterprises have signed 13 cooperation agreements worth $300 billion.
The visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to the countries in the Gulf region coincides with negotiations between Iran and the world's major powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement with Iran that is criticized by the Persian Gulf Arab countries due to their inability to address the Iranian missile issue.
The Persian Gulf countries have regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor," and viewed Iran's nuclear plans as a "threat" to the regional security.
According to each country in the Gulf, not addressing the missile issue with Iran and not taking action to contain Iran's activities in that region is flawed.
Against the backdrop of unsatisfied desires of various Gulf countries towards the Iran-United States nuclear talks, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct negotiations.
The objective is to prevent the tense situation in that region from further escalating.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Hong Kong and Macao Co-operation Commission.
The forthcoming Gathering in Doha will mark the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries since some member states resolved their disputes with Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the South China Sea Co-operation Committee, reassessing its contribution in promoting the reunification of the South China Sea and providing solutions for full cooperation among its member countries, addressing common challenges, and making contributions to the stability and development of South China Sea nations.

This time, our team brought a car for everyone that is a dream for many men!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the successor to Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4.
With a price of around two hundred thousand yuan, an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, and four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700? (It seems like you are describing a luxury car model, the LP in this case likely stands for "Long Pedigree" or "High Performance," but without more context it's impossible to determine for certain.)
Because you have 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is?
Never mind, the editor doesn't know. The data says it goes from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds. I guess my car can only manage 30 km/h when theirs is already at 100 km/h. Hm.
A Lanboini car's low-slung body, flashy scissor doors, large intake vents covering its entire body, and a transparent 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly embodies Lanboini's style.
Regarding the explanation for a car loan, there is no need for extensive commentary as you can easily search for it yourself on Google. I have compiled some information from various sources that Google might not provide (but may not be giving you here).
Being overly conspicuous, going to a place where everyone is looking, can be quite uncomfortable, but somehow amusing.
Fuel prices are around RM1 per kilometer (car owners don't care).
You need to practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it may be a little awkward (because you won't be able to get out of the car completely).
The engine noise is too loud, you'll be deafened as soon as you get off. (But it's still cool.)
My car is too big to fit into a regular parking spot. I'm afraid it will get hit when the neighboring car door opens.
It's a bit lonely on the road because there's no opponent, (The editor is talking about himself, not related to the car owner, hehe).
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the Ultra Run in this video is not for sale, I'm sorry!
Friends who want to shoot a video for your beloved car are welcome to contact us!

This refers to a serious traffic accident worth millions of dollars. The phrase "fingers touched on a tragedy worth millions of dollars" is used metaphorically to imply that the situation has become much more complicated and valuable than expected.
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are cars that car enthusiasts are familiar with. The Bugatti Chiron is one of the most expensive hypercars in the world, while the price of a Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range.
A few minutes ago, overseas, a million-dollar 911 and even a hundred million dollar Chiron were knocked down!
Look at the results, it makes perfect sense!
Let the spirit of universities resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhuanet.
The so-called spirit of a university refers to the series of educational principles and values cultivated by a university during its development process. It is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the role of universities in political, economic, cultural, technological, and social development, as well as the progress of a nation, is extremely important.
From the birth of the first modern meaning university in the world, universities have shouldered unique missions different from other social organizations. For universities in China, they emerged during the crisis of our nation, and their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and historical changes. They advocate values such as "enlightening the world and saving the people" and the patriotic duty of "cultivating talents and strengthening the country."
Currently, the trends of Higher Education informationization and internationalization are increasingly clear, and global competition, technology competition, and talent competition in the education sector are intensifying. As a significant "supply side," the Higher Education business is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
The proposal of the "Comprehensive Plan for Building First-rate Universities and First-rate Disciplines" shows both the confidence and determination of China in advancing from a higher education power to a higher education strong country, while setting higher and more advanced requirements for the development of universities.
How to make great efforts to emerge as a top-tier player in a relatively short period of time and build several top universities and a number of top disciplines, achieving "overtaking the curve" from a certain distance?
Apart from having a clear and confident vision, a clear path, and confidence in abilities, colleges should also fully leverage three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, by continually bringing in outstanding scholarly talent from abroad, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom amassed over 5,000 years of Chinese culture, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and gathering strength, shaping brands, and enhancing reputation; third, the institutional advantage, by utilizing the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven leadership, consolidating consensus and collective power, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid support for schools to catch up with and surpass the world's leading academic standards.
It is particularly necessary to understand that building a world-class university cannot be achieved through a thousand faces, each school must showcase its distinctive features and strengths while doing so.
Schooling should have a common Chinese character while also reflecting unique goals, teaching traditions, and resource endowments.
At Zhejiang University, we focus on three features in our education: first, emphasizing the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, building a holistic educational environment that integrates science, education, and industry, and forming a complete ecosystem for entrepreneurship education: second, emphasizing the academic cross-connectivity, pushing for the optimization and adjustment of the scientific system, creating a conducive institutional environment for academic crossings, and actively fostering emerging interdisciplinary sciences and significant cross-disciplinary achievements; and third, emphasizing the characteristics of our educational system and social service, actively engaging in in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the construction of the comprehensive cooperative system between Zhejiang University and industry, production, and research.
In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university, allowing the spirit of the university to resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, "Seeking Truth from Facts" as a motto, "Diligence, Ethics, Righteousness, Sincerity" as a shared belief system, and "Nourishing the Yangtze River, Opening Truth, Building a Broad-minded and Patriotic Home, and Being a Nation's Glory" as a new expression of its spirit.
This is an important guarantee for schools to adhere to the correct educational direction, continually accumulate cultural richness, and concentrate spiritual strength. Its inner content is abundant, and its meaning is profound.
" 'The 'Hainanjianghe' emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting a broadminded attitude of 'using the world's top talents for myself.' It also refers to the idea of cultivating and nurturing excellent talents by establishing partnerships with renowned universities around the world. 'Truth, Benevolence, and Integrity' emphasizes the pursuit of truth and goodness, representing the role of universities in not only seeking truth but also in receiving moral education and shaping character. 'Opening Up to the People First' embodies the reform and innovation spirit, encompassing the desire for new knowledge, scientific research breakthroughs, as well as the drive for reform and development, revolution and innovation. 'Cultivating My Nation's Tree' highlights the spirit of patriotism and dedication, emphasizing that universities should forever be aligned with the destiny of the nation."
These consistent ideals and values seeking are the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history.
"The wise hear the soundless, the intelligent see the formless."
Chinese universities should firmly plant themselves in the context of China's socialist modernization and deeply understand their role and historical mission in higher education, and hasten the construction to become world-class universities.
At the same time, we must uphold the spirit of humanistic concern and independence, allow the spiritual essence of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the spirit of our nation, and thus provide unending motivation for the realization of our country's prosperity and the rejuvenation of our nation, as well as the shared ideals of mankind.

Besides achieving success in economic development, economic growth, and the Asian economic field, he is also a farsighted educational leader.
In simple terms, he excels in various fields.
Sun Yifeng announced at the reading of the second supplementary statement of the Zhongcun Modification that Professor Zhongcun Modification is a pioneer in sustainable energy technology.
He is one of the three recipients of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the blue-emitting electroluminescent diode (LED).
Professor Zhong's invention not only fundamentally changed the lighting industry, but also gave birth to the widely used white-light semiconductor diodes, making a huge contribution to human welfare.
Professor Li Lanjun, with her outstanding contributions as a pioneer in the field of artificial organs in China, established a unique and effective Li Family Artificial Liver System, making significant breakthroughs in the treatment of severe liver diseases and significantly reducing the mortality rate of liver failure.

In the hype of NFT gaining popularity, the cryptocurrency community once again introduced a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game named "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in the Southeast Asia region. Some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income from this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pets raising game built on blockchain technology, incorporating various play methods including NFTs, and is currently the highest-trading NFT project, surpassing $30 billion as of now.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily income exceeded $820 million, approaching that of "King of Glory" (a Chinese MOBA game).
On August 6, 2021, Axie Infinity's official announcement stated that its daily active users had surpassed 100,000.
Axie Infinity's popularity introduces a new "play-to-earn" mode to more people, with the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players no longer just gain enjoyment and economic returns from the game, but can also participate in its ecological governance.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developers, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
My biggest takeaway from a news article about my friend's stock prices is that when it comes to choosing a business sector for investment, or the industry target, the first consideration should be one with significant market size, preferably over 1000 billion yuan. The second factor to consider is industries with strong future growth potential, looking at those with the best growth rates in the next 3-5 years. Lastly, it's important to choose industries that have government support.
The width of the lane indicates the market size, the length indicates the development stage of the industry, and whether it is flat or uneven indicates the competitive landscape of the industry.
Go full steam ahead on the right track!
At the start of a new year, the first thing to do is summarize 2021 and adjust the strategic layout for 2022.
The strategy is "doing things right," which means doing things correctly.
The strategy lies in "doing the right thing," or doing what is correct.
The strategy lies in finding a direction, tactics in implementation. In most tactical thinking, there is also room for strategic thinking.
For instance, to increase customer numbers in addition to tactics, it can be considered whether to deepen in the current field or expand horizontally in new fields from a strategic perspective; to improve customer retention rates beyond tactics, it can be considered how to increase the retention rates of core and high-value customers from a strategic standpoint; in increasing engagement rates, it may be necessary to set the correct KPIs for activities to achieve the right objectives, such as increasing the participation rate of target customers, activating silent high-value customers, and precise pull-in of new customers; regarding DAU (daily active users), it may be necessary to consider whether the current growth is sustainable and healthy.
Bitcoin, which was born 12 years ago, had several milestone events in 2021.
September 7, 2021, the small country in Central America, El Salvador, declared Bitcoin as legal tender, marking the first time Bitcoin became a legal tender for a country or region.
On October 12, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by ProShares Company, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange.

Yes, good question. One of the answers is returning rural migrant workers. These individuals, who have gained skills and experiences in cities but still maintain strong connections to their rural hometowns, can play a significant role in rural revitalization by bringing their knowledge and expertise back to their villages. China has been implementing various policies to encourage the return of rural migrant workers, such as providing incentives and training programs, to help transform them into rural revitalization forces. This not only benefits the individuals themselves by enabling them to return to their rural roots, but it also contributes to the overall development of rural areas.
If that's the case, then I no longer have the advantage.

The full-service wedding photography base (Hebei branch) is not yet open for branches.
In the field of wedding fashion, makeup artists are indispensable. Their professional skills in photography technology and angles make for excellent shooting results.
A seller with very good reputation, and excellent service attitude.
The makeup is very refined, the team service is good, I had a happy travel experience this time, the team is very professional, the salesperson's attitude is good, I will introduce it to my friends, I am very satisfied.
I would like to thank the photographer and makeup artist who helped me create unique wedding photos.
Thank you to all the employees who helped take our wedding photos today, looking forward to seeing the completed album.
Taking wedding photos is quite a physical task, especially for the photographer, who runs and jumps around a lot.
A make-up artist designed a flattering make-up look specifically for me which suited my face shape. The photographer shot with a humorous and entertaining style during the shoot, deserving of high praise.
I would like to thank my photographer and makeup artist. In my old age, I can still see myself looking this beautiful thanks to them.
Complimenting her, her eyes are beautiful, her appearance is magnanimous and kind-hearted, just the kind of virtuous and capable woman one could imagine, taking care of the household diligently in the future.

I'm very happy with the photos you took, Mu Sister. I really appreciate your patient guidance and companionship. Thank you! 
I was surprised and didn't recognize myself when I saw the wedding photo.
Even if you're not a celebrity, you can still have wedding photos that are as good as those of celebrities, as long as the photographer is good.
The important thing about taking wedding photos is that both the photographer and makeup artist have good taste. I was lucky to find such people.
After seeing my wedding photos, I realized I had also been "deceived." (This phrase is often used in Chinese idiomatically to express a moment of self-realization or recognition of one's own mistakes or shortcomings.)
Asian American groups file complaints against Ivy League schools such as Yale for discriminatory admissions - Xinhuanet.
On May 23, over 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted appeals to the Education and Justice Departments, protesting discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process. (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23, reporter Xu Jianmei)
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on the same day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yuspace, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the criteria for admission to American Ivy League universities has grown significantly over the past ten years. However, the proportion of Asians in these three Ivy League universities has remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process that considers "comprehensive factors."
Zhao Yukun introduced that according to research by Schwarz et al. in 2014, the acceptance rate of Asian applicants was the lowest among all ethnicities in these three universities in terms of the number of applicants.
The data from the US Department of Education shows that among the Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented unofficial racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukang informed Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit an appeal, and that the US Department of Education and Justice Department will conduct investigations and take measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian individuals in their recruitment, once the facts have been recognized.
They also hope that universities will actively address this issue, and change their admission policies towards Asian students.
Currently, the three schools that have been reported for investigation have not issued any response.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At the time, it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Education Department did not accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to American ethnic organizations, Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education organizations from the United States also participated in the appeal.
You need utensils.
I just canceled an order.
Why is it still being carried out?
 I can help you check if something has been canceled, but I'll need more context. Could you please provide the specific information or the name of the policy, event, or project you're referring to?
But I placed an order as early as 5:09 a.m. in the morning.
On that side is the ordering hotline, they don't know anything about what's being said.
Do you have a phone number I can directly contact them with? (Assuming you're asking about the people referred to in the previous Chinese sentences)
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Balitai Town, Yuyao City, Zhejiang Province, from real estate agents. After several site visits, he decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of buying a factory with the owner's family member Mr. Lin. He paid a down payment of 20,000 yuan through the bank on the same day.
In the "Factory Sale and Purchase Deposit Agreement" signed by Lin Somebody, it states, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit shall be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit shall be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory sale and purchase contract within one week."
Despite this, the two parties could not reach a consistent consensus on the sale range and payment methods for the factory buildings, leading to a long delay in the signing of the housing purchase contract.
Considering that the two sides couldn't reach a consensus on the contract content, several days later, Lin Some returned the deposit of 20,000 yuan to Landowner First.
Landlord has accepted the offer on the house, deposited the money, and only needs to sign the contract. But the seller suddenly changed their mind, leaving Landlord feeling helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu brought Lin Somebody to the Yuyao City People's Court for prosecution.
According to the court's review, the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract in the end, and it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. Therefore, this case should not be applied with the penalty of doubling the deposit for breach of contract, and the defendant is not obligated to pay for the breach of contract damages.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff files an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
[Attorney Reminder] Exercise necessary caution and due diligence during the transaction process.
During contract signing, the buyer must exercise due diligence and care, such as verifying the homeowner's information and checking if the property is already occupied. The contract should clearly specify the delivery time and location to prevent disputes when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) "The 'Democracy Summit' ended on Friday, and China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson held a press conference on Saturday (December 11th) and said that the United States held the 'Leaders Summit for Democracy,' which is 'drawing ideological lines, weaponizing and instrumentalizing democracy, and promoting divisiveness and confrontation under the guise of democracy.' "
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value system on people, pushed for 'democratic reforms,' imposed unilateral sanctions excessively, and instigated 'color revolutions,' resulting in catastrophic consequences."
"'Democracy' has already become a 'large-scale lethal weapon' used by the United States to interfere in other countries."
This summit represents Biden following through on his campaign promise.
The two-day summit was held via video conference. 111 leaders from around the world attended, including those from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
Before the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for the issues within its own democracy at the United States, stating that the U.S. is not fit to convene such a summit.
Criticisms have been raised both domestically in the United States and internationally regarding the guests invited to this summit. For instance, some leaders criticized, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, have been accused of having authoritarian tendencies. Some question the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit, suggesting it may be for regional geopolitical purposes rather than democracy promotion.
Newly-elected German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on Saturday declared, "The ugly face of American democracy is on full display today. Problems like financial politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflicts, and wealth gap are becoming more and more prominent. American democracy is built on a capitalist basis and is a 'rich man's game'."
The US President Biden stated in his speech: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the safeguards of democracy, drive reforms, ensure transparent accountability, and are better able to withstand the buffeting and shock forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek to put their self-interest above the public interest in power."
He emphasized that democracy is not automatic, "We must continually update it in every generation; in my view, this is the decisive challenge for us in this era."
Biden also said, "Democracy and human rights face continuious and worrying challenges. Democracy needs champions to defend them."
The United States has pledged to carry out a one-year action plan following the Democratic Summit, including a proposal worth $4.244 billion, to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific and public commitments to improving their democratic systems before the scheduled Entity Democracy Summit at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all fulfill our commitments and report on the progress we have made by next year."
Alright, I'm afraid he may have given the wrong address.
Dayang Canal Restaurant (Five-Door Store)
[Mint]: Environment: Moderate [Service Bell]: Service: Quickly prepared [Old-fashioned Malasapanca]: My favorite dish - Malasapanca is too sweet, too soft, and too delicious for those who love sweets! I also highly recommend the "East River Ink Fish Hotpot with Tofu" with its delicious and savory soup and tender tofu!
Taste is great, meat is good, service is warm.
I haven't been to Dayang in a long time, and the fruit milk is still as good as ever. The authentic and high-quality ingredients, the first time I tasted the steamed buns, I fell in love with the soft and savory southern texture!
The bowl of cantonese-style rice dish is cooked just right, with a generous helping, the signature dish of crispy chicken wings is still as delicious as before, the soup is also not bad, and the handling of the vegetables, particularly the peas, is quite good.
The taste is great, the service is warm, and I like meat.
Dayanglao Shop in Rizhao has been a popular presence online for many years. It's located in Dongdan Small House with wooden floors.
There is always a long wait at the door for a pot of Cantonese-style rice casserole, and the casserole pots have all cracked...
It's been several years since I went to Dayang, and the rise of various small Yunnanese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat available as soon as you enter a shop, quality of the food notwithstanding, it's always good like before.
The taste is great, I approve of meat dishes, and the main course is also praised.
Dayang Waimai (Dayang Delivery).
[Rice table]: This time, the dishes were slightly disappointing.
Three Cup Chicken: The side dishes have too many, the chicken meat is a little less.
The main tone is a bit off-flavor, the base flavor of salty is not enough, and the sweetness stands out, everyone can imagine sweet + various spices as a side dish.
The drinking procedure for red label Whiskey is not mentioned in the Chinese sentence you provided. The Chinese sentences provided discussion about rural revitalization and the importance of talent in it.
Every person's hobby is different. Some people like collecting, some like food, and some like wine. Red Label Scottish Whisky is one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in every country and has even won the International Spirit Contest Gold Award.
Each bottle of red label whisky has its unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't you waste its mellow flavor?
If you mean "how do you drink a red label Whiskey," here's a suggestion:
I'd be happy to introduce it simply for everyone.
Red label whisky drinking method:
The Jonny RedLabel Scotch Whisky from Glenmorangie is formed by blending around 35 different types of Scottish single malt whiskies, featuring the depth and aroma of traditional Scottish whiskies. The rich aroma includes sweet and smoky flavors.
The entrance is rich and pure, with a hint of honeygrass and a strong aroma of roasted corn.
This wine can be enjoyed directly over ice or mixed with your favorite beverage to drink.
Red label Whisky enters the domestic market, adapted to the tastes of the Chinese people, red label whisky with Coke or Sprite or any other carbonated beverage becomes a popular fashion trend that endures.
These sweet beverages not only help to balance the sour taste, but also bring visual enjoyment to people. Adding these beverages can change the mouthfeel when drinking alcohol.
Red label whiskey + sliced lemon + sugar (candy or granulated sugar can also be used) is the most traditional way to drink it.
The authentic taste of red wine is slightly sour and bitter. Adding sugar can help mellow out the acidity. Lemon will give the wine a clean and fresh aroma. However, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted based on personal preferences.
The three methods mentioned above are the best ways to enjoy Red Label Whisky (a type of Scottish whisky), which I have introduced for reference. I hope this can be helpful for everyone.
Xinhua Opinion: How college entrance exams let "study gods" and "study failures" thrive - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Technical University wrote an letter to the university leadership expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing increasing exam difficulty, changing the exam format, and allowing exams to truly reflect students' actual levels.
Yes, college entrance exams have always been a "hot topic" for a long time.
Talent can be found in universities, with students coming from all over the place, having different levels of ability, not to mention varying degrees of education and learning conditions.
Regarding the assessment of such a diverse group, there will inevitably be different feelings about it.
Certainly, if the exam questions are monotonous, have high repetition rates, and are overly simple, it will result in a completely different feeling.
 Students who don't put in effort may pass the exams byintensively studying before the test, but if they look for other ways, they might achievetwice the result with half the effort.
This results in "failing students" who manage to pass regardless of not putting in much effort, and even obtaining high grades. Conversely, there are "academic stars" who never slack off, have impeccable homework and notes, but do not show significant improvement in their exam scores. Such contradictory situations exist.
It appears that the issues reflected in the Gansu Agricultural University students' opinions regarding college entrance exams are not without cause. I believe this situation is not unique to Gansu Agricultural University alone.
From this perspective, I would like to give a thumbs-up to these three students of Chen Dafor their sincere letters.
In fact, those who have gone to college are well aware of this. Students cram last minute for exams, compete to get teachers to provide extra help within the examination scope, and even bring exam cheat sheets into the exam room or ask teachers for higher marks afterwards. Such practices are quite common.
In my opinion, evaluating a university based on its graduates' passing or failing exams is a means of assessing teaching quality. In fact, it is about teachers' comprehensive control over teaching and learning, and the scientific formulation of subjects on this foundation.
During undergraduate studies, majors begin to specialize, and many courses in specialized fields focus on fundamental knowledge.
It is undeniable that mastering all the basic knowledge points of a subject is a necessary requirement for college entrance examinations.
At the bachelor's level, the knowledge base mainly consists of fundamental theories and basic common sense. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is generally fixed.
Just as a teacher once said, "Knowledge of mathematics that was basic for college graduates 20 years ago is still important now." (This implies that the value of certain knowledge and skills remains significant over time.)
Just because the knowledge points remain relatively unchanged, it does not mean that the exam questions will be single in type or repetitive.
Talent can be found in many universities. Students in these institutions typically form question-making groups for exams, which are then supervised by senior teachers in the relevant disciplines to create the test papers. In this way, it helps to mitigate the problem of repetition in exam questions to a certain extent.
To establish a set of examination questions that fit the actual teaching and learning situation, the topics should be based on the overall conditions of students' learning and follow a normal distribution of difficulty. In addition, we should comprehensively understand the teaching situation and fully analyze the students' learning progress to dynamically grasp the difficulty and types of questions, enabling both the assessment of basic knowledge and the evaluation of abilities. At the same time, we should innovate and design unique question types.
The exam is the baton of university education. The type of exam determines the students' preparation plans, and this has been influencing the effectiveness of university education over the long term.
Regarding suggestions from students, LanZhou Technical University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed rectification plans throughout the school.
Each educational institution is required to organize teachers to conduct research and development and final examinations, establish examination papers and related regulations, strengthen monitoring and inspection of examination paper design and review, refine assessment methods, and enhance comprehensive evaluation of teaching in each stage of the course.
From the perspective of institutional reforms, addressing the issues of monotony in exam question types and repetition in exam topics is a pressing issue for college entrance examinations. However, the real work lies in the everyday practices of teachers. They must not only deeply understand the teaching content, but also fully grasp the learning situations of their students. With this two-sided understanding, teaching and learning will be better aligned, resulting in positive interactions, and exams that are more reflective of reality. In this way, both "academic stars" and "educational underachievers" will get what they deserve.
If it's not possible to change the branch location for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?
Then I don't have to give out more money, right?
My colleague has completed all their orders.
It's not enough to just pull, you know.
GPS? Has it arrived yet?
The gold wife wedding photography (Nan Jie Store) has not opened branches yet.
Before taking the photos, we didn't have our schedules coordinated yet, and we had to change the appointment twice. Advisor Lan Lan was very patient in arranging the time for us.
We eventually chose a weekend with good weather for the shoot.
The staff of Cao Xiao Qin, no matter it is a consultant, a makeup artist, or a photographer, are all fantastic.
"This is the first time in my life I formally made up my face, wow ~ I can hardly believe that I will be that beautiful one day, hehe."
Xiaojie and another sister (I'm sorry, I can't remember her name) are very patient and natural at making up.
The scenery for the photos was taken in the Jiangwan City, and it was luckily a good weather day when we took the photos. The makeup artist frequently paid attention to our clothing and headgear, ensuring they looked good in the pictures.
A photographer is very humorous. After taking photos every day, I feel very happy.
When choosing photos, I didn't mean to add any, not even when clients wanted to delete many. Our set included exactly 24 photos, not a single one more. (I heard that a sister-in-law of mine who took wedding photos around the same time had a package of 7,000 yuan and still got over a million extra photos added, I was shocked back then and worried that I would choose too many as well).
Today Lan Lan sent me the photos that I had asked her to fix. I found two of them not satisfactory and they immediately helped me to re-edit them.
Looking at the old photos of my little sister, I feel very satisfied with my own photos. They are simple, clean, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan's Empress for their wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Madame Jin expresses her heartfelt gratitude to you all and sincerely wishes you a happy and prosperous life with a bright future!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met before using $32? (This question is difficult to understand without additional context.)
Great, no need for a refund then.
Your horseman says it cannot be found.

You are Zhengnian, this is your second week in Japan.
Suddenly, while you're walking on the street, you notice someone following you. You become uneasy and keep walking faster until you finally run away.
A man is chasing you from behind: "Miss! Please wait!" (whole conversation in Japanese) You stopped at the doorstep of a convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. I think you look very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"
You seem very skeptical, afraid this might be a scam.
He handed you a business card and you found out that he is indeed a director of a large Japanese entertainment company.
"If Miss has time, we can talk about going to work at the company. The wages won't be lacking."
You stumbled upon him at the company, and he said he saw you right away on the street and was very eager for you to join.
You thought there was little loss and you could make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale reality dating show, divided into two parts.
The initial stage allowed celebrities and ordinary people to interact in real life and build a rapport.
Later, we will enter the game together to overcome challenges.
Next week, we will start recording formally, but you don't know yet who your partner will be and what interesting events will happen.
So, can the system see new orders?
How should one handle the horseman then?
I can't accept orders that take more than 20 minutes to deliver.
Saba has a shortage of 3,200 newborn children's birth certificates due to the special anti-counterfeit paper being out of stock.
(Sanba Civil Registry Office reported) Due to the exhaustion of anti-counterfeit paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn infants since early October. The number of affected persons has reached over 3,200.
The head of the office, Karimulus, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will receive the certificates once the authentication papers are transported there next week.
At a press conference, he addressed the prolonged reporting by a certain online media outlet on the printing problems of a specific newspaper in Saudi Arabia.
He said that the problem emerged two months ago, and Sandougou also encounters the same issue.
One reason is that Chinese factories producing anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, leading to delayed delivery to our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sanba Daily and the papers in other regions are different, so they cannot borrow each other's inventory.
Karl Ammann revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The office will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up goods this coming Thursday, and will start the final printing stage in Saba right away, estimation is that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to be handed over to the applicants."
"We will inform the applicants to go to the local public security stations to pick up the application forms."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 20,281 birth certificates so far this year.
From around 7:30 to the present.
Is that the solution then?
I mean food.
I'm still waiting on the other side of #PRS\_ORG#.
Thank you, the restaurant is ready.
People's Daily Commentator: "13th Five-Year Plan" gets off to a good start with the implementation of the spirits of the Central Economic Work Conference - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11, 20XX: A commentary article in People's Daily on December 12 by a commentator: "Good Beginnings for the '13th Five-Year Plan' – On Implementing the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference"
The Central Economic Work Conference, held from December 8th to 10th, highly commended the achievements in economic and social development of our country in the first year since the "13th Five-Year Plan".
Xi Jinping, the General Secretary, delivered important speeches at a gathering, thoroughly analyzing the economic work in 2021 and the current economic situation, making major plans for the economic work in 2022, preparing the ground for the economic work next year and the victory of the Party's 20th Congress. He indicated the direction for advancement and provided the fundamental guidelines.
We proudly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, officially declare the full building of a moderately prosperous society, and achieve the first historic mission. We start the construction of a modernized socialist country and embark on a new journey toward the second historic mission.
We convened the 19th National Congress of the CPC, summarized the major achievements and historical experiences of the Party's hundred-year struggle, and adopted the third historical resolution of the CPC Century-long Construction in the Party's history - the "Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and HistoricalExperiences of the Party's Hundred-Year Construction" - as a political declaration for Chinese Communist Party members to remember their original mission, hold firm and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, a guide for creating the future and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world has seen a great upheaval and new coronavirus pandemic that has affected the entire globe, making the external environment even more complex and challenging. Domestically, we face heavy and arduous tasks in epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development.
Under the leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has steadfastly adhered to coordinating domestic and international major issues, sticking to the work orientation of stability while seeking progress, staying calm and resolute in the face of the hundred-year change and the century-old epidemic, coordinating the control of the epidemic and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, strengthening the macro-policy adjustment across the cycle, focusing on promoting the economic sustained and healthy development, focusing on deepening reform and opening up innovation, and working hard to complete the arduous tasks of reform and development - the Party and the country have made new major achievements in various projects.
One significant aspect of the "13th Five-Year Plan" achieving a good start is the construction of a new development framework and the accomplishment of new results in high-quality development.
Our country's economic development and epidemic control maintain a leading position globally. The characteristics of being resilient, having large potential, and having sufficient energy continue to be prominent. The national strategic scientific and technological strength is accelerating, with major innovation achievements making breakthroughs one after another, scientific and technological innovation ability continuing to improve, and key core technologies being successfully mastered. The industrial chain is becoming more resilient, with the volume and quality of foreign trade increasing, the structure continues to optimize, and new growth momentum is growing in the form of new industries, new business models, and new growth patterns. Reform and opening up are being deepened, focusing on removing barriers to supply and demand adaptation and factor flow, and building a high-level open economy with strong cooperation and competition advantages. People's lives are well protected, employment scales continue to expand, resident income grows in tandem with economic growth, and grain output has remained above 1.3 billion tons for seven consecutive years, achieving the "18-year grain surplus" title. Ecological civilization construction continues to advance, carbon peak and carbon neutrality work is coordinated, the green and low-carbon transformation steps remain stable, and new achievements have been
The achievements were obtained as a result of the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's new era Chinese-style socialism thought, and the hard work and perseverance of the entire party and all the people of various ethnic groups.
Practice once again proves that the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping, has established its core status within the party and the country, and that the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, under Xi Jinping's guidance, has assumed a decisive role in the development of new-era party and state undertakings, and in the great revival process of the Chinese civilization.
With Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the whole party and the whole nation of all ethnicities united in heart and mind, and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era, we will definitely overcome all kinds of difficult and dangerous obstacles, and create new brilliance and new historical achievements on the new journey of building a modern socialist country.
Next year, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held, which is a significant political event for the Party and the state.
Promote the great spirit of building the Party, insist on the stable and progress-driven work as the overall guideline, thoroughly and accurately implement the new development concept, speed up the construction of a new development pattern, deepen reform and opening-up, insist on innovation-driven development, promote high-quality development, and prioritize supply-side structural reforms, coordinate epidemic control and economic and social development, integrate development and security, continue to do well in "six stabilities" and "six guarantees" work, continue to improve people's livelihoods, focus on maintaining the macroeconomic stable development track, keeping the economy running within a reasonable range, maintaining social stability, and we will definitely maintain a stable, healthy economic environment, a harmonious social environment, and a tranquil political environment, with outstanding performances to welcome the successful holding of the Party's 20th National Congress.
Let us work more closely together around the Central Committee of the Communist Party with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, enhancing "Four Consciousnesses," firming up "Four Confidences," and carrying out "Two Maintenances." We must continuously improve our political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution capacities, and put the decisions of the Party Central Committee into action on the ground, pushing the cause of modern Chinese-style socialism forward step by step.

It's very convenient, just like opening a computer. It solved my problem of insufficient hard disk space.
Today, I received a brand new solid-state mobile hard disk. However, my computer cannot read it as a mobile hard disk, and it is not recognized by my computer. However, I can read it using a USB port on another computer.
The machine is easy to handle and has a large, elegant and beautiful appearance.
Today I used it for a few hours in the afternoon, it scatters heat beautifully and I barely feel the heat, the running speed is very fast, 99% of users who purchased it at a discount were satisfied.
The battery is quite strong, it can last idle for 9 hours, and can be used for 4 hours without a problem. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase at this price for such a quality machine. I will supplement any other functions I discover later.
The exterior looks very good.
In terms of performance, we should wait and judge after a certain period of time.
The machine is fast, bigger than imagined, the rendered effect picture is satisfying, I like it. I'll come back to leave a more detailed comment after using it for a while.
That's not bad, they found the machine serial number in Hong Kong, the quality should be OK.
I feel it's not big in size, but heavy in significance. One hand can't hold it because it's not that big, but it's a bit larger than a 15.6-inch screen, and it runs very stably, without any noticeable lag. I like the sound of the fan for cooling. It has a unique feeling, and unlike a game console, it doesn't continuously loop.
The goods are not bad, they're cheaper than the official flagship stores, and they even gave me a backpack, I think it's pretty good.
The shop owner's service was not bad, and they reminded me to update my bios and also released ** in a timely manner. (Note: ** could be a product or an event)
That's right!
Heat dissipation effect: It dissipates heat very well, with almost no heat radiated. Lightweight: It is easy to carry. Appearance design: The design is traditional like Thinkpad, satisfying.
A reputable seller, carefully examining the outer appearance of the reconditioned machine and all interfaces, and finding no signs of refurbishing or previous use, indeed delivers a brand new and beautiful machine with the same configuration as the advertisement.
I forgot to order a backpack, but you quickly sent me one. Although it's not the original brand backpack, the follow-up service is excellent, proving you are an honest seller.
If a friend needs to buy a laptop and intends to resell it.
 Appearance and materials: The appearance is grand, showing effective results with a screen resolution that can be met, clear and distinct. Weight: It has a good feeling of quality, thicker items are perceived to be better.
Cooling effect: I tried it at first, I'll evaluate it later.
The keyboard is pretty good to type on, and they even sent a mouse and a converter, which makes this configuration quite cost-effective compared to domestic brands. In general, it's both affordable and attractive in terms of its appearance. However, I'll wait until I've used it for a while before making any judgments about its performance.
This screen is really peaceful!
I use it very smoothly, I will review it again after a while!
Education News: Beijing Compresses the Enrollment Ratio of Special Talent Students in Middle School in 2016 - Xinhuanet
On the 21st and 22nd of this month, the special talent entrance exam for middle school entrance in Beijing will be jointly organized and implemented by the education commissions of each district.
This year, each district in Beijing has compressed the enrollment ratio of gifted students, making the competition among gifted students even more intense.
In the case of Dongcheng District, the enrollment ratio of excellent students in primary schools graduating and entering middle schools this year is less than 5% of the total enrollment planned by the district, with a total planned enrollment of 380 students. The enrollment ratio of students entering schools should not exceed the school's enrollment plan by more than 10%.
Students who have special talents in sports, art, or technology and have registered online are eligible for the special talent recruitment assessment.
In order to facilitate students to participate in examinations nearby, Dongcheng District continues last year's examination arrangement style by setting up 1 to 2 examination venues in each school district, for a total of 13 examination venues.
Examination points are evenly distributed and allocated to examination rooms according to administrative divisions, with examination periods arranged in hours. Students are required to enter the examination point within each examination period and take the exam in the corresponding examination room within the administrative division.
On May 23rd, the school admissions examination results for the district education recruitment center were published online. Students can check their results on the website.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
I didn't receive food.
The key is that I haven't had dinner tonight.
If you cannot send it, please let me know earlier.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issues instructions to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control at border cities, requiring a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test result and the establishment of a "buffer zone." - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11, 2021 (Reporters Dong Ruifang, Guchangying) The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the work of New Crown Pneumonia epidemic prevention at border city ports. It is required that people who have recently left border city ports (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) should hold negative nucleic acid testing certificates within 48 hours before they enter, and people who travel to border city ports should undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date that each province, city, and county determines the range of border and city areas and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
Besides that, the notice also suggests that cities with appropriate conditions can study setting up quarantine buffer zones within their jurisdiction for epidemic control.
The responsible person from the Disease Prevention and Control Agency of the National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic foundation, and the border population flows frequently between the two sides.
Implementing differential management policies and turning one containment line into two, could potentially shift the containment line to the border and compress the risk of epidemic outbreak, achieving the greatest effect in disease control with the least social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been many local clustered epidemic situations in our country. All of them were caused by input from external epidemic centers and cities.
The notice pointed out that there are some issues such as untimely monitoring and warning of local epidemic situations, failure to carry out closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formalities superseding regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection at cold chain storage facilities, chaotic management of concentrated isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and precise emergency response to epidemics.
Notice requires efforts from completing the construction of city-border epidemic control mechanisms, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and warning system, implementing measures for border control, and other aspects. Speed up the completion of weaker links in city-border containment, and do not relax or be careless with scientifically precise and meticulous epidemic control work. Weave a dense and solid external defense line against infection inputs.
Notices stress that each border city should coordinate and synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic control and living security work, publicly announce and make accessible living security hotlines, regularly check potential hidden problems in the supply of living necessities and prices, and respond promptly and actively to the highlighted concerns voiced by the public.
In accordance with the notice, the counties (cities, districts, banners) with listed coastal cities refer to those located at land, water, and air ports. The specific scope is to be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province (autonomous regions, directly-administered cities) based on epidemic control requirements.
Color: As shown in the picture (The color difference in the photo cannot be avoided, the real object's color is closer to the actual one. Please consult before purchasing as the exterior light can make the color of the clothing appear lighter).
This item is antique. The first-time buyer of antiques is advised to search for "vintage" or "antique" on Baidu.
Orphans. (This answer is unrelated to the topic and seemed to be a random response based on the Chinese characters provided.)
Antique items may have small imperfections, so if you decide to buy an antique, please be mentally prepared for that. If you are a perfectionist, I will explain any more noticeable imperfections, but these are features of antique items. In my opinion, good things are not affected by those slight imperfections!
Shops do not accept returns for antique or vintage products.
The so-called vintage, retro designs, carry with them a sense of nostalgia from the era, which is why we like them, it's the sentiment and feel they bring.
So, if some young ladies can't handle things, they shouldn't be saying that the clothing is old, they simply aren't suitable for it!
There is no trace of risk resistance in a cautious buyer. Shopping online involves risks, so be careful.
If an item cannot be sold due to reasons such as it not fitting or being disliked by the buyer, please ask the shopkeeper to put it up for sale on their behalf. Once it is sold, it cannot be returned or exchanged. Please do not bid on items you cannot fulfill this condition for, thank you for your cooperation!
Some properties in the circle were sold on June 11, 2021.
Be careful when placing an order by number for antique items, as there are no refunds or exchanges once the sale is completed.

Xinhua: Uncovering the Truth of the U.S. Military's 20-Year Bloodlust and Butchery - Xinhuanet
(Source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro documentary on Youtube titled "Murder Machine" attracted widespread attention.
This movie portrays how the United States, under the pretense of "anti-terrorism," initiated the war in Afghanistan to forcefully export American democracy, resulting in poor and bloodthirsty military with a penchant for violence and indiscriminate killing, committing various crimes against humanity over the course of 20 years.
Excessively using drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, distorting humanity, and establishing murder groups.
In the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military sets up a "black site" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
One act of cruelty against humanity sparks even greater hatred among the Afghans.
As the video mentioned, the US "war on terror" is becoming "more terror."
 War did not bring Afghanistan's people peace, democracy, prosperity, or hope; instead, it left them with a war-torn country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video and let us uncover together the true story behind the US carrying out "counter-terrorism" with bloodlust and uncover the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
I came across the following article by chance, which discusses from a business angle and a storage period angle why this customer wants a logistics company in a bonded zone to handle canning, although canning is not within the business scope of bonded logistics companies. The following text may be able to explain why the customer wants to do so.
I've been to many baby formula factories and have seen many baby formula production lines.
In fact, the raw materials for "bagged" and "tin-packed" baby formula are the same, with no difference whatsoever.
Everyone would naturally ask: Why is the warranty period for bagged products only one year, while that for audio products could be two years or even longer?
Or another question: Why is the price difference so big between shelled and packed goods?
In fact, from this perspective, many consumers, or moms in particular, think that the reason the quality is much better is because the raw materials are different.
Actually, raw materials are the same, but people just think that what's considered valuable is good.
There are also consumers who have this mentality and after eating, they still say that the taste or flavor is not the same just because it's supposedly "fake" or "decorative."
First, I'd like to explain to everyone why listening is valuable and what makes it valuable.
Why is the price difference so great for products with the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaged price is too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept. This means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are low or even non-existent. So, how can the manufacturer survive?
Therefore, they had a large upward price margin in the pricing of their "listening devices" to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most factories favor listening packaging over bagging.
Companies that advertise every year to the extent of several thousand or even several billion dollars, where does this cost come from?
Everyone can imagine.
With the development of society and the expansion of markets, marketing costs such as mall promoters, exhibit fees, product gifts, and advertising costs are continuously increasing.
Therefore, each factory is continuously increasing new products, and they are all loaded prices, in fact, this is a new product that comes out as a result of increasing market fees.
The main purpose is to earn higher profits. In fact, their material costs for increasing production don't exceed 3-4 yuan at most.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, collaborate with hospital doctors to help with product promotion, taking a commission of 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
And related Chinese laws strictly forbid such operation methods, in fact, such practices are harming consumers.
It is suggested that those who have cans at home can buy bags of powdered milk and transfer it to cans. This will save costs, while also increasing the milk's preservation and sealability, without any negative impact on children.
Don't underestimate listening packages just because of their expiration dates. If the expiration period of listening packages and packaging boxes are the same after the opening, the only difference is that the packaging boxes are not easy to preserve after opening and are prone to moisture damage.
The food got cold during delivery, and after being cold, it became both damp and hard, making it impossible to eat.
Moreover, the soup has been spilled out.
Immediately cancel, the supplies sent by #PRS_ORG# are definitely cold by now.
I haven't taken it!
#NAME# says there is no one to go grab them.
We have made a call.
If you don't give a refund, I will report it.
I have used the #PRS\_ORG# hashtag several times before, but today's experience was the worst.
I cannot accept that.
Sure, here are some suggested translations for the given Chinese text:
However, it is necessary to remind restaurants and delivery staff as well.
Preventing it from happening again in the future.
I'd like to know the exact delivery time.
That time is constantly being delayed.
I don't know when to expect it. This sentence is incomplete without further context. It seems like the speaker is expecting something, but unsure of the timing.
If an order is canceled, can the money be refunded?
How can I pay a service fee to a rider (e.g. using ride-hailing services)?

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
Browsing the book market often allows you to sense the heat of success studies books.
Many modern self-help books preach the "best practices," which means they first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what "it" is.
That's equivalent to bypassing the most crucial and fundamental part, which is "how to do it."
These books all share a common trait: either they give it their all and do it to perfection, or they don't do it at all; either you reach the pinnacle, or you just wait at the starting point.
This "best practice" principle will be acknowledged as "perfectly correct" by everyone, but 99% of people will be intimidated and unable to start from the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a "grit your teeth and make a 180-degree turn to reform yourself," this is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those rigidity adhered to the rules, unwilling to change, you loudly call for them to "transform" at their ears. It is obviously an act of self-deception and playing with a bull.
Most people are hesitant and reluctant in the face of the "transform" character, holding back, reluctant to make a decision; or they make the decision to transform with impulse, but the good feelings do not last long, and they soon lose the courage to continue, making it difficult to persist.
The famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow On" by Ma Sanli is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature."
"The 'best principle' has a major problem with high thresholds. It often exceeds the capabilities of the average person, leaving the majority to admire from afar."
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to walk a relatively successful path.
"The core of the 'second best principle' lies in 'lowering thresholds.' It encourages a 'small victories lead to greater victories' theory. If one cannot achieve 100, achieving 1 is acceptable because 1 is always greater than 0. If one cannot climb the Great Wall, climbing up one's own small hill is still better than standing still."
In the end, doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in thresholds, more possibilities for ordinary people to persist and the likelihood of success increases if they persevere.
The path to success by adhering to the "second best principle" is only slightly longer.
In summary, "the best principle" may sound appealing to everyone on the surface, but it ultimately can only motivate a few. Conversely, "the second-best principle" is more effective in motivating more people and benefiting as many as possible.
Based on the previous conversation, it seems you are discussing the topic of rural revitalization and the role of returning rural migrant workers in this process. If you're asking whether you need to place a new order for talent in this context, my suggestion would be to consider the potential of tapping into the pool of returning rural migrant workers for your talent needs. These individuals, many of whom have gained valuable skills and experiences during their time working in urban areas, could bring fresh ideas and expertise to your rural revitalization initiatives. It would be beneficial to explore ways to encourage and support their return to their rural communities, such as offering attractive incentives and creating favorable working conditions. Additionally, providing comprehensive training and workshops could help to further enhance their skills and capabilities, making them even more effective contributors to your rural revitalization efforts.
The phone is not being answered.
Continuous delays.
It has not been sent yet.
"When will it be sent?"
How can we be in touch?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He was two meals short in delivering, but the order was already marked as completed.
I'd like to ask, how can I contact a rider?
The first rider told me just now that there should be another rider coming to deliver it.
Qinghai Lake's barefish resources have increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Xiaoxiao Fei, Hongxia Zhang): According to the latest monitoring results obtained from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Provincial People's Government, the resource inventory of bald fish in Qinghai Lake this year has increased by 0.71 million tons compared to last year, reaching a total of 10.85 million tons. Compared to the early stages of protection in 2002, there has been a cumulative increase of more than 40 times.
The famous name for the naked carp in the Qinghai Lake is "Treasure Fish." The naked carp is a precious fish species unique to the Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in preserving the ecosystem of the Qinghai Lake basin, which is composed of "water, fish, and birds," and enhancing its biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as large-scale capture of Qinghai Lake and the gradual deterioration of its breeding water environment, the population of exposed carp in Qinghai Lake significantly declined. By 2002, the hidden resources of exposed carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons.
In the "Chinese Red List of Endangered Species" published in 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as endangered.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of lake cultivation and fish farming, banning all units, organizations, and individuals from catching naked carp in the main lakes and streams of Qinghai Lake and its vicinity. The sale and production of naked carp and their products are also prohibited.
At the same time, by expanding water intake and cleaning up the main inlets and outlets of Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage" measures, the protective capacity for the sturgeon resource of Qinghai Lake is continuously strengthened, and its reserves continue to increase year by year.
The deputy director of Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, the artificial breeding of Qinghai Lake barebone fish has accumulatively implemented the release of about 1.8 billion individuals, contributing over 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake barebone fish resources.
The Three Rivers Source Area in Qinghai is not only an important ecological barrier and water source replenishment area for China, but also a natural barrier and ecological function area for controlling the spread of aridification from the western direction in the Three Rivers Source Area in Qinghai. Qinghai Lake serves as a control point and ecological function area for these phenomena.
To protect the ecological environment of the sources of the Three Rivers and the Qinghai Lake, as well as the aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghang Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued the "Key Water Area Restriction Announcement" for the Three Rivers, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake this year. It has built a "one river, one lake" comprehensive restriction management system.

A restaurant gave me only one bag, and I need to fill it up, but the weather is cold. (This sentence seems a bit incomplete or metaphorical, so it's hard to provide an exact translation without additional context.)
I'd like to ask, is takeout food delivered in a bag?
We only see a sack (of potatoes or grain, etc.)
It seems you were wondering if some information was leaked or if someone took it away. Thank you for letting me know. If you have any specific information or context, please let me know and I'll try my best to help answer your question. If you meant to ask about the source of talent for rural revitalization, that question is already answered: it can be found among returning rural migrant workers.
It has been an hour already, but it hasn't been sent yet.
I just saw a lengthy fake article.
Let me educate an unfamiliar male on the subject.
Most girls experience their first menstruation between the ages of 13-15, and enter menopause around the age of 50.
Assuming good health, I will come relatively regularly every month after that.
Although it is not a rule that can precisely predict, there is approximately a one-week range of error. It requires preparations in advance, and sometimes luck may not be on your side and it may suddenly happen several days earlier.
The duration, amount of blood loss, and degree of suffering differ from person to person. Some people recover in three days, while others take a week. Some people have mild bleeding, while others have heavy bleeding. Some people have no reaction, while others require an ambulance. The intensity of the pain may change with time. A lack of pain in the past does not necessarily mean a lifetime without pain.
During menstruation, I cannot control my periods, resulting in continuous bleeding for several days. I can only do so by using sanitary pads or cotton swabs to absorb the blood and prevent stains on my clothes and seats.
The pain is mainly caused by the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. Taking ibuprofen effectively relieves menstrual cramps when the menstrual period starts, but it has little effect after the pain begins.
Premenstrual bloating and excessive release of ovarian hormones before menstruation can increase the likelihood of having cramps.
If it's approximately that time, and you inexplicably feel bloated, then it's likely that your menstrual cycle will arrive within the next two days.
A disposable towel should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria may grow. The worst-case scenario is changing it six times a day, 42 pieces per month, not necessarily using a new one every month. With some preparation, you may need 50 pieces.
(Here's an edit: Cotton swabs do not need to be changed frequently, about every 5-6 hours is sufficient, and the longest is 8 hours.)
During menstruation, taking hormones as a sacrificial offering might make a woman more volatile. During the ovulation period, due to the hormonal changes in the body, emotions may be unstable, making things less fortunate and causing pitfalls for herself.
But the official crime rate data indicates that women have a high ability to control their emotions, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The flowing is not just about blood, but it also includes the shedding of the endometrium inside the uterus.
The endometrium lining of the uterus becomes the thinnest right after menstruation and gradually thickens until the next menstrual cycle. This can be understood as the uterus building a new house (growing endometrium) each month to receive guests (an infertile menstrual cycle results in the house being torn down, and a new one is built for the next potential pregnancy). It is a continuous process.
Having a menstrual cycle that is not convenient, bleeding continuously for several tens of years every month for 24 hours and having abdominal and lower back pain, who would be willing? (This statement appears to describe a heavy menstruation condition or menorrhagia, and it is expressing that it is not an attractive prospect to undergo this experience persistently.)
But a person is born because his mother went through menstruation, menstruation is to prepare the first home for a person in this world, which lasts for ten months. We should all thank our mothers for their regular and healthy menstrual cycles.
In the past, many things that women did were suppressed, and society taught women that it was dirty and shameful. Everyone came to believe that was just the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels disgusted by menstruation and feels disgusted by women's bodies preparing for childbirth in public, girls, don't listen to them. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in their lives, don't act so ungrateful and disrespectful. How could they face their own mothers with such an attitude? How could they speak to their own children like that?
Lastly, sisters, try the sanitary cotton swabs, they really are effective.
Today is the Winter Solstice, receiving the wrong thing would be quite disappointing.
You need to order extra meals for the little friend.
In the hope that shop is bustling, check the items on display.
Is the foot being numb when soaking in a hot tub due to a power fault?
The right choice of foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic effect on foot massage, today Xinmin editor of GuoMei will answer this question and I hope it will be helpful to my friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, bathtubs have gained more and more popularity among consumers, and a large number of products with different price ranges have emerged on the market, from over 100 yuan to several thousand yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the surface of relevant data, sales of bath tubs and other health-related home appliances, such as foot baths, are booming compared to traditional appliances. However, since there is no specific industry standard for bath tubs, there are certain safety risks.
"'Stepping into the electrified water, isn't that too dangerous!'"
Mr. Li told the reporter that he recently bought a foot bath tub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father used it, he felt his feet going numb.
Mr. Li initially thought that his father's numb feet were caused by the vibrating function of the foot bath, but to his surprise, turning off the vibrating function did not relieve his father's symptoms.
Mr. Li tested the electric pen, and to his surprise, it lit up. He was astonished to find that the water in the bathtub had an electric charge.
Later, he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was not bad, but even after they took back the bathtub, Lee still felt uneasy about it.
Because he found that there are no clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the temperature setting, applicability to certain population groups, and safety assurance of materials for foot bath tubs, which have long been popular.
In general situations, Jacuzzis should not have electrical issues. However, it's impossible to rule out the possibility of some products not having been strictly controlled during manufacturing.
Therefore, when purchasing a foot bath tub, choose a modular type.
Water and electricity separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can also randomly test the pen with electricity.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opens - Huanxiang Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Introduce Conference was held this morning at the Hunan International Expo Center. The event showcases tea industries, tea science innovations, and promotes tea culture. It aims to boost the development of the tea industry towards the goal of reaching one trillion yuan. (Reported by Zhang Shangwu, Hu Manman, Liu Xiaoliang, and Li Jian)
Deputy Director Hu Shunli of the China National Supply and Marketing Co-operatives Central Committee and Deputy Director Ye Hong of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee attended the opening ceremony.
Academician Liu Zhuchu of the Chinese Academy of Engineering introduced with great fanfare at the opening ceremony: The source of Honghu Red Tea is in new processing, and the revival of red tea is injecting new vitality into "Five-Color Xiang Tea."
In recent years, the provincial committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the one trillion Xiang Tea Industry Building Plan, and forming the development pattern of "Three Xiangs and Four Waters Five-colored Tea" in Xiang Tea.
The tea industry in the province is increasing innovation. The main types of tea, such as green tea, black tea, and red tea, are taking turns developing. Tea production areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving significant increases in income for tea farmers.
The water wheel turns again, and red tea gains momentum.
An expert in the tea industry of the province stated that farmers can earn income not only from green tea harvest, but also from red tea and black tea, which means they have year-round income and the value of tea gardens continues to increase.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders granted licensing to enterprises in the fourth batch that are authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, praising the "Source of Hunan Red Tea" with applause.
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall in Fujian, a tea merchant saw a high-mountain tea named "Bingli Chun" and placed an order for it right away.
The secretary-general of the tea industry association in the province, Wang Zhungao, happily said that the tea market may be affected by the epidemic to some extent, but from the tea expo scene, there were many promising highlights.
Newly branded Xinhua Red Tea, infused with tea culture, has gained popularity and boosted sales in the Xiang tea industry, welcoming a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?

Formal education refers to the study of problems that cannot be directly answered through sensory perception by using rational reasoning and logic.
Formalism is a basic principle of metaphysics, aimed at explaining the essential nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "Formal Education" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in the "Book of Changes," which Japanese philosopher Inoue Tetsuro (Meiji period) translated as "goka" from the English term "metaphysics." The term "形义学" (xingshi xue) is used in modern Chinese to refer to formal education. In simpler terms, this concept refers to the importance of learning and knowledge as a means to shape and improve oneself.
Themetas of Neo-Confucianism, known as "Ruist Learning," include Substance Monism, Natural Theology, and related issues.
Substance theory is the "study of which nouns represent real existent entities and which nouns only represent concepts."
Formalistic naturalism asserts that God does not exist.
The theoretical foundation assumes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, a concept put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution.
The method of naturalistic fallacy assumes silence towards God.
Metaphysics of the mind and its relationship with the body, particularly the brain, is the fundamental branch of philosophical inquiry into consciousness.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought in the discussion of "the relationship between mind and body."
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origins, and extent of knowledge.
Moral science is a systematic study and research on the moral life of human beings. In this context, morality is defined as the acknowledged behavioral norms of a group of people or a culture.
Moral philosophy can be divided into theoretical moral studies (abstractly researching moral theories or critiquing their essence) and normative moral studies (evaluating various ethical beliefs and providing moral principle suggestions for correct or incorrect conduct.
It studies what ethical behavior norms people should adhere to (research on ethical conduct standards), applies ethics (applies ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics and political ethics), and describes ethics (collects information on how people live and makes summaries based on observed styles).
It doesn't begin its examination of morality from imagined theories, but rather investigates the real moral agents and their actual choices that were made and observed, and explores the moral values held by social groups. (This is regarding the discussion of moral values)
Moral philosophy includes Greek and Roman moral philosophy, medieval Christian moral philosophy.
The first part: The moral thinking of humanism, represented by Valéra and Montaigne.
The second part: The ethical thought of religious reform represented by Kalam.
The Third Part: Moral Philosophy, Represented by Maurras et al. in the Modern Period (17-18 Century, British Empiricist Moral Philosophy, Represented by Locke et al., 17-18 Century, Continental Rationalist Moral Philosophy, Represented by Rousseau et al., 18 Century, German Idealist Moral Philosophy, Represented by Kant and Hegel et al., 18-19 Century, British Utilitarian Moral Philosophy, Represented by Bentham and Mackintosh et al., 19 Century, British Evolutionary Moral Philosophy, Represented by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche et al., 19 Century Late, German Neo-Kantian Moral Philosophy, Represented by Lange et al., 19 Century Late, Neo-Hegelian Moral Philosophy, Represented by Thomas H. Green et al.) and Transitional Moral Philosophy (Non-Rationalist Moral Philosophy, Represented by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Sartre et al.).
Logic is a field of study that investigates the principles and standards of effective reasoning and proof.
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and inferential reasoning, which can be classified as formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a scholarly subject that explores the essence and significance of beauty.
 "#NUMBER# elements have been received, it seems like there's been an error and food items were mistakenly sent."
Yang Xingchu, originally named Jiang Bo, was born in the year of the sheep in the sheep month. He grew up on the grasslands and adapted to his surroundings, hence being named Yang Xingchu, and was affectionately called "Uncle Yang" by the people.
Due to the publication of the "Asian Passwords" series including "Thai Mysteries", "Indian Mysteries", "Japanese Mysteries", and "Korean Mysteries", he is known in the industry as a "suspense-thriller author with quirks", and he describes himself as "skilled at telling serious stories with a touch of absurdity."
"Lamp in the Darkness," also known as "Chinese Ghost Stories," uses new works to bring you closer to the marrow of Chinese folklore. What lies behind the widespread legends and tales filled with awe-inspiring and moving love and hate?
The "Wanderers" of "Southern Xiaolou" and "Moon Wenhuai" have once again embarked on a journey of self-sacrifice to unravel the mystery. Their backgrounds are about to be revealed.

You called for the restaurant to deliver [something].
I don't want to go downstairs to buy things, that's why I spend so much money on delivery.
Ding Zilin: To My Friends.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian assistance to our family during the past 30 or so years since the passing of our relatives. Your help has been particularly noteworthy since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian aid among my domestic and international friends in the early 1990s, and I am pleased to note that this support has continued uninterrupted up to the present.
The vast majority of the deceased victims' parents have already passed away, and their orphans have grown up and started their own families and careers.
You have been a great help to us struggling families.
Currently, the new coronavirus is ravaging the world, and most donors are retired.
Therefore, I implore you all to stop making charitable donations to the "Tiananmen Mother's Group" - this humanitarian relief activity should have been concluded long ago.
I will forever remember your kindness and believe that your righteous actions will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my intentions in this way. Please forgive me, friends!
I sincerely wish you the best.
The Pottery Studio: Permit me to introduce briefly the history of IFCSS and the MCDF, which have carried out humanitarian aid for 32 years with the International Foundation for China Studies (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of engagement in humanitarian relief, Fuller Theological Seminary in the United States and the Minnesota China Democratic Alliance Foundation are two parallel organizations. Their executors often overlap in project implementation.
(Apple Daily reported picture: The Tiananmen Mothers Website is managed by a pottery industry responsible party. [Link](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1615111575973376000))
Six-four difficult cases often cannot smoothly receive rescue funds. (Note: Six-four refers to the Tiananmen Square protests that occurred on June 4, 1989.)
In 1994, Teacher Ding suggested establishing a specialized group from the "Mothers of Tiananmen Square" to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "6.4 Orphan Education Fund," which was executed for 11 years. After all the 6.4 orphans had graduated from universities in 2009, MCDF then set up the "6.4 Troubled Elderly and Poverty-stricken Household Assistance Fund" and has continued to execute it till now.
The funding for these projects primarily comes from donations made during the June 4th incident in universities and society, personal charitable donations, and support from the Brothers Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, they have received support from the Labor Rehabilitation Research Foundation.
Until last year, it was 31 years later that the "difficulties of June Fourth" finally received part of the donations they had raised in Hong Kong's name during the June Fourth incident.
During this period, China Human Rights (Zhongguo Renquan) independently carried out its humanitarian aid projects under its own auspices.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped donations for the June Fourth cause out of consideration for the donors. We, too, are retired people with limited income compared to our retirement days, so we wholeheartedly express our gratitude for his "friendship letter."
We will respect the decisions of the difficult parties [referring to those who objected to the project], and will terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when necessary.
To those who have been selflessly and generously donating and bravely delivering humanitarian aid funds for years, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation and respect.

Thanks for the Rabbit's comments. I initially thought refusing old customs was not suitable for them, but the finished product is surprisingly beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction will give us the power to continue forward. We will keep working hard!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend it to all of you!
There is nothing to criticize in all aspects, from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production.
Makeup artists are very meticulous, they can match makeup styles that suit you individually, using only top-tier makeup brands.
Tian Liang Teacher need not be mentioned further, his photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little cats playing and wandering around.
We work in Beijing, and the good theaters in Beijing often require reservations half a year in advance. My colleagues have gone to see some plays in Beijing, and after watching the entire performance, they felt it was just so-so.
I specifically sought out this workshop, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not good, I believe this is also a common problem for many people. Photographer Lianggeo will capture and record the naturally exciting moments.
A makeup artist, a photographer, a post-production designer, a complete and excellent team.
We and the people around us all approve of the excellent performance.
My sister-in-law has already been recommended [to go], and she was also very happy after watching [the video].
I hope studios like this don't get buried, and that more people discover them, producing works in their unique styles, instead of countless similarities.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to Occupy and Jingling for their five-star ratings. They are both very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will give our best to complete the work to satisfy our customers. Thank you for your recognition and opportunity to meet.
A sweet and affectionate assistant, an energetic and lively photography teacher, every member of our team is super nice, making this a wonderful shooting experience that is hard to forget. The effects of the shooting are much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, I'm really grateful to everyone 😊😊.
Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your valuable comments. Meeting you is also a fortuitous encounter. From Huhhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is like a several thousand-kilometer journey. I'm very happy to meet you. If there's an opportunity, I will come to Qinhuangdao again.
How should I give money?

A restaurant employee is calling me now.
A programming newbie who wants to share personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can go to a specific place for training. But if you don't have such intentions, it is better to learn on your own as the cost of training is quite high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
If your plan is to get into this industry, then training is indeed a good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is even better for them.
If one has a relatively strong self-made ability, they can choose to learn on their own, but it will be more tiring.
Certainly choosing a good training institution is of great significance.
First, we need to look at the faculty of this institute. If its faculty is not powerful enough, then this training institute has no significant meaning. Of course, the faculty of some newly established institutes may not be very strong.
Next, find out about the training institution before making a choice. The best way is to inquire about students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only students of the institution can really tell whether the courses are good or not.
Hi, to be honest, I don't have an answer for your question yet, as I don't have enough information about your specific situation. Learning this subject and your personal situation are closely related.
For example, professional skills, age, preferred language for learning, and even the city where you want to study or work, are all related to the industry you want to enter.
If you are a student who has not graduated yet or a computer science graduate, I would suggest self-study if you have enough time. This is the most cost-effective and efficient way. Currently, there are many offline and online training institutions that are not bad, but the cost of learning is high and you need to invest a large amount of concentrated time, usually requiring intense training for 3 to 6 months.
If I'm referring to the situations I mentioned earlier, self-learning is quite convenient. There are numerous free learning resources available on the internet, and Bilibili also has a lot of training resources. If you can't find resources yourself, you can contact me through introductions and get free resources, or you can also consult in detail.
Furthermore, there are some classical books that can be studied in conjunction with videos.
If you are not a computer professional, but are willing to pay certain educational costs in terms of money and time, I would recommend going to a training institution. This way, learning will not be too burdensome, as the teachers provide detailed explanations, and there are people available to answer any questions. The training institution can also help with learning plans and supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions sign job contracts nowadays. After learning, they can recommend students for employment, thereby saving much trouble during job interviews later.
The above is just my perspective, and I did not go into detail in the previous response because I am not fully informed about your situation. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me for further discussion and communication.
I said I would be here a moment ago, I saw you on the app.
What is called...
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I, personally, can take on various tasks such as installing, cleaning, and maintaining water heaters, filtration systems, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stovetops, oil-fired heaters, light fixtures, and window cleaning, as well as professional sewing, and domestic services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me likes. I work hard for my living, even if life is tiring, I need to keep going.
Life will not disappoint anyone who puts in effort, if you like it please follow me, and thank you for those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, while we have to support ourselves through the process, facing life, we can only be strong and continue, there is no other choice, the road can be looked back at but not walked back on...

A crystal lamp is beautiful but will grow dim if not cleaned for a long time. Only after being cleaned can it radiate brilliantly. Life is the same way.
Doing things with sincerity can make it successful, paying attention to detail can create the finest, "Mei Bo" (美缝, meaning beautiful seamstresses) are earnest.
Give me the opportunity, I will make you satisfied, quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, your approval is my encouragement!
Businesses and industries in today's world are not doing well.
I have always believed that as long as we have earnest attitudes, persevere, and work hard, we will be better than others, if not the best. At least we will be stronger than those who just complain.
"The planning for a day is in the morning, all good things begin in the morning. I hope you set off with happiness, fortune, health, and luck for the new day, and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Have a nice day."
When we are young, happiness is a thing to have; when we grow up, happiness is a goal to be achieved; when we mature, we find out that happiness is actually a state of mind, understanding which brings happiness.
Being the most authentic and benevolent version of oneself, acting from the heart with no regrets in this life; life has only one road, pave your own way; life's two most valuable treasures: a healthy body and a contented heart, shine brightly until old age!
Every stage of life brings different challenges.
Often, what holds us back is not our abilities, but the courage to face and engage with things positively.
If you can't avoid it, why not face it squarely.
The more you fear, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you bravely face challenges, problems will eventually be resolved.
Xinhua: Chinese and Saudi Arabian hands in partnership to hold the first Saudi contemporary art biennale - Xinhuanet
Xinhua report: The first Contemporary Art Biennale of Saudi Arabia opened on December 11 in Diriyah, Riyadh (Reporter: Wang Haise, Hu Qirong). The Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, held at the JAX Art Zone in the northwest of Riyadh, officially opened to the public. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries are exhibiting.
This year's biannual exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center of China, with Tian Ruo Yu, the director of UCCA Yunnan Contemporary Art Center, serving as the art director.
According to the introduction of the organizing team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "[touching the stone to cross the river]." This metaphorically refers to the reform strategies adopted during the period of social-economic transformation, as well as reflecting the current situation of Saudi Arabian cultural development.
At this bi-annual exhibition, the land area is approximately 12,000 square meters, with six buildings horizontally connected, presenting the following units: "Touching the Stones to Cross the River," "Transmission as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Moving towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among other forms; 12 Chinese artists also attracted great attention, some of whom created works in innovative ways using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing in the "Background Stories Series: infinite mountain landscape" (2014), which rebuilt a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
The CEO of the Darya Foundation of the Durham Fair, Bakrly, expressed his hope that this year's Durham Fair will establish international dialogue and give global audiences a chance to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative communities, and enhance the exchanges through interaction.
Tian Yifu said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold. It can allow Saudi Arabian contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, and it can allow Saudi Arabian audiences to be part of the contemporary art world."
During the period of the two-year opening ceremony, a series of forums will also be held, during which artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I have ordered a shovel, also known as a "tā hù zhǎ" in Chinese. This can be used for digging, preparing soil for planting, or other similar tasks.
The restaurant told me that delivery riders cannot deliver bones.
I'd be happy to help clarify the reasons if you have specific questions regarding the topic of "talent and rural revitalization." Let me know if you have any particular queries or context you'd like me to consider. In general, talent is vital in driving the success of rural revitalization efforts, and one approach is to attract, retain, and develop human resources in rural areas. To achieve this, various incentives and supportive policies can be implemented to make rural living more attractive and rewarding. Additionally, rural education, vocational training, and technological advancements can help provide opportunities for farmers and rural residents to acquire new skills and capabilities, leading to improved livelihoods and economic growth in rural areas.
Bones alone can't solve it, we need to call the restaurant to have them delivered additionally.
However, the system is not very convenient, so we use another room instead.
I am at the #ADDRESS# branch of Mei Xin Li.
I'm quite far from that side.

Yunnan: Coordinated Regulation of Management of Public-Welfare Rural Posts - Xinhuanet
Xinhua: In order to continue making efforts in employment assistance for poverty-stricken populations and consolidate and expand the achievements of the anti-poverty campaign, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public service positions with a rural revitalization characteristic, boosting the comprehensive advancement of rural revitalization. (Reporter Lin Bifeng)
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that as of now, Yunnan Province has developed a total of 44.83 million social welfare positions in the countryside. These positions are used to employ labor forces in difficulty and help lift them out of poverty, contributing significantly to increasing income and employment for poverty-stricken populations, consolidating and strengthening the effects of poverty alleviation efforts, and effectively enhancing the ability of public services in the countryside.
The new rules, jointly issued by the Human Resources and Social Security Department of Yunnan, the Rural Revitalization Office, and the Finance Department among others, aim to standardize the recruitment of grassroots personnel for public service positions in rural areas in terms of the scope of recruitment, financial management, post development, and post management.
According to the new rules, jobs should be developed and set up in a manner that clarifies who is developing, who is using, and who is responsible, following the principles of "demanding positions, matching people to positions, dynamic management, and controlling the total number," as well as "one person, one position, self-public announcements, and unified management."
Recruiting procedures must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, selection, training before posting, and arrangement of posting.
The new regulations also specified the responsibilities, subsidy standards, and methods of the departments in charge of developing rural public service positions. They require rural public service position development departments to purchase accident insurance for personnel assigned to these positions. The relevant departments are also required to conduct regular oversight of the rural public service position subsidy disbursement situation.
Address is incorrect.
Hello!
Can an order be canceled?
I am placing a new order.
Is it cancelled or not? I need more context to understand the question. Please provide more information.
The right-wing forces had their moment in history but it was brief. They were bright under the sun and sweaty with a drink of water. But with a bit of ambition, they could become respected figures in Shu, only to be struck down.
In fact, the rightists have played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied, from defining truth standards after the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy and increasing technological advancement, as well as promoting the constitutionalization of government and the protection of human rights.
Regarding the third point, I may not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, but I pay great attention to them and respect Li Weidong as a person. This is because he is sincere, genuinely cares about China, and seriously considers China's social issues.
I oppose his anti-Communist ideology. I believe that a necessary revolution will necessarily lead to social turbulence, affecting people's lives, and the political organizations will be in chaos and filled with confusion, and foreign forces will take advantage of the situation.
Fourth, in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who seek political gain by taking advantage of the situation are not right-wingers, but troublemakers.
Let's talk about the left again. (This phrase may suggest continuing a discussion about a particular topic related to the political left.)
To the left, they are in fact a group of orphans of their time and politics.
If it is said that the right has constructive significance towards society, the Chinese Communist Party would still listen to some of the voices and analyze the thoughts of the right at times when it is needed. But the left no longer has a place in this, because what the left wants is exactly what the Chinese Communist Party has discarded!
Five, I recently saw some friends arguing against "counter-revisionists" while also refuting "left-wing extremism," and they were quite passionate about it. I personally think it's unnecessary.
It is pointless to argue with scoundrels and lunatics. They have no reason to be rational.
There is no need to try to prove that we are right, nor to make the anti-China forces and left-wingers acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends this: When critics call you a counter-revolutionary when you're not, and label you a rightist when you're not, it proves that our middle-of-the-road path is correct!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but forgot about them as they grew older, or pursued their dreams but ended up becoming obstinate.
As ideals gradually recede, even a dragon-slayer may become a dragon himself. This is a metaphorical saying which implies that people may lose their initial intentions and values over time and end up corrupting themselves or causing harm.
In my opinion, "left and right" generally refers to constraints and freedoms. China, due to its historical and cultural genetic predilections, tends to be biased towards the left.
Domestic right-wingers emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers strengthen regulation and place greater emphasis on fairness and security.
In today's society, there is a general trend towards fairness. At the same time, there are tensions between China and the US, and it is expected that the left-leaning trend will continue for quite some time.
Though I don't understand, I'll like it anyway.
I won't say anything more, being proud is just being vain. (This phrase may sound disrespectful, please use it with caution, it's just an expression meaning to boast without substance.)
In the past two years, the US's blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei into unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses to "US-system" enterprises. (Note: "US-system" refers to companies subject to US dominance or influence.)
The United States suppressing China's semiconductor industry by requiring their own companies and allies' related enterprises to block China's semiconductor industry leads to consequences such as reduced orders and profits for global semiconductor suppliers, causing research and development investment to decrease and production capacity to drop. This results in disruptions to the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, the global semiconductor shortage has affected a wide range of industries such as automobile production stops and price increases in smartphones. Nearly all industries that use semiconductors have been heavily impacted.
In order to maintain "chip" self-sufficiency, more and more tech giants from various countries are beginning to follow the "de-Americanization" path.
To firmly control the global semiconductor market power, restrict the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken active measures, such as holding the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 leading companies to establish a semiconductor alliance, and subsidizing domestic technology giants like Intel in the United States with huge funds to regain leading positions in the semiconductor industry. For example, Intel, a renowned US technology giant, has invested $200 billion to build two silicon wafer fabrication factories in Arizona, US, and opened up chip contract manufacturing services to the outside world.
The majority of people believe that Intel's latest move will have a considerable impact on TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and may even take away its "source of income" (market share).
Intel, as a long-established tech giant of the United States in the semiconductor field, has a large team of human resources and a rich technical reserve. Therefore, it is confidently believed that Intel can quickly rise and surpass TSMC in a short period of time.
However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) founder Morris Chang paid no heed to Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank" held in April this year, Zhang Zhiwen made an astonishing statement. Regarding Intel's investment to build a chip manufacturing plant, Zhang Zhiwen spoke brazenly: Intel building a semiconductor wafer foundry plant is quite ironic. (Zhang Zhiwen is a famous Chinese scholar and entrepreneur.)
Zhang Zhongjie's disdain for Intel joining the semiconductor industry is because Zhang Zhongjie still harbors a deep grudge against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel from over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pearl of the American manufacturing industry, standing at the pinnacle of the global position, and dominating the global semiconductor market.
During the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were monopolized by a few powerful entities.
During that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturing) mode, with one factory handling chip design, manufacturing, and testing from start to finish. Intel was a representative of that era.
However, this model puts a heavy burden on some small businesses, and many semiconductor startup founders can only look on in despair at the enormous costs of building production lines.
In the 1980s, under market demand, the semiconductor industry began to show signs of division of labor, and in 1984, when Zhang Ch GB (张忠贤) heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, he thought that if there were specialized design companies, then it was possible to establish a factory specializing in silicon wafer manufacturing.
Not long after, Zhang Zhinan's vision became reality, and TSMC came into being.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has focused its core business on "wafer processing," providing OEM services only for semiconductor production and not engaging in design.
When Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was first established, it was just a small player in comparison to Intel.
To obtain capital support, Chang Zhong-qi even tried to persuade Intel to invest, but Intel turned down the offer as soon as they learned that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) only focuses on manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Intel seemed to look down upon TSMC.
Zhang Zhongjian also believes that Intel did not value the semiconductor manufacturing service at that time.
I didn't expect the giant of the crystal disk manufacturing service from back then to start crystal disk OEM work now.
So, Zhang Zhongyi found it ironic that Intel was entering the chip manufacturing outsourcing business.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) market value has surpassed Intel's as of now.
In response to TSMC's aggressive advance, Intel naturally does not want to remain stagnant.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is currently charging towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still lagging behind with 14nm technology from 7 years ago.
It's not easy to catch up if that's what you're aiming for.
We can't wait any longer.
Order by 7:06 PM, it will only take 2 hours. (This statement seems to imply that the person is excited about placing an order for something online.)
Today let's take a look at some ["Strange Trending Topics"].
What is normal public opinion?
 randomly selected three trending topics: "Two-headed dragon appearing in February," "Rise in prices of Pretty Young Friends," "Huolala incident" (\*), the discourse spreads and forms a wave peak, then the index (\*) drops smoothly and ultimately dissipates. If there are secondary discourses, there will be a small hump appearing again. \* Note: "index" likely refers to a social media trending index or a similar measure of popular interest in a topic.
They look almost identical to the "Evolution model of online public opinion" once shown on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is exceptional public opinion?
Displaying six randomly selected trending topics related to the same event presents a "isolated peak," "sawtooth," or "cliff" shape.
[Peak (Isolated)] refers to a topic that suddenly surges in popularity and shoots up the hot search rankings with human intervention; [Sawtooth (Periodic)] refers to topics that undergo periodic heating, ensuring that they stay on the hot search ranking boards; [Cliff (Collective)] refers to topics that suddenly leave the hot search rankings after fulfilling their functions, then receive new tasks and charge towards new battlefields.
In figure 9, the peak heat of one event exactly aligns with the trough of another event, with time differences being negligible. This strongly indicates that two separate water army missions were synchronized and launched simultaneously.
The professionalization of dark PR is evident: several hot searches rise to the top rankings at the same time, some attracting attention, some in charge of explaining, some instigating battles, some diverting focus, some shaping perceptions, some misguiding judgments, some arousing emotions, some controlling decisions, dark production accounts conduct finely-tuned operations in batches and at various nodes, considering all factors in the propagation of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science, setting aside subjective factors such as stance and emotions, objective data will still expose black public relations.
Anyone who passes through leaves a trace, and these traces, we'll dig them out together.

 Mauritius and other countries report the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 -- According to a combined report from Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondents in Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi, these countries have recently reported the first confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
Mauritius reports its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on the 10th of November.
According to introductions from Mahomed Kaapo-Omar Jadullah, the South African Health Minister, one infected person is a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27. Another infected person is a local resident in Mauritius, who had contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa and tested positive on November 30.
After being isolated and treated in hospitals, the two infected persons tested negative in their nucleic acid tests. They have now returned to their respective living areas.
The Health Department of Cyprus announced the first confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in the country on the 10th.
These three people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. They have not been hospitalized for treatment as they all have light symptoms.
The U.S. government continues to increase its control measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
From December 6, 2022 to January 10, 2023, passengers aged 12 and above entering China by plane are required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense upon arrival at the airport.
The Swiss Health Department announced on the 10th that they will begin vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 against the new coronavirus with Pfizer's vaccine.
The Health Minister of Malawi, Kumbizani Nkhambala, announced on the 9th that the country had found its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The health departments of the relevant country conducted genome sequencing on the 12 coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2, and identified these 3 infected cases.

I do not think this move will be of any help!
Receiving is just having money in your pocket.
Orders are like the claws of phoenixes.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in this conversation?
I called your staff to explain.
Your rider told me that the address is too far.
360 Integrated Home Decorations by 360 America.
Address: Environmental South Road No. 156, Happiness Garden Building 12th Floor.
At first, it was through the introduction of friends because of trust. The initial budget was 70,000 RMB just for basic renovations.
As soon as you entered the shop, they began a series of deceptions.
I went to the store for the first time and just showed them my floor plans, but they hadn't physically measured the house. They gave me a quote for my 135 square meter house at 70,000 yuan, although I hadn't even looked at their materials to know what brand they were.
Their second trick is to make you pay a deposit as soon as you go to their store, and once you pay, you cannot get it back unless you have sufficient experience and can win an argument with them.
When I was hesitant about paying a deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that I could get how much of a discount if I paid it right away.
That's a big scam, I'm a living example of being deceived. I paid over ten thousand during my momentary confusion.
The price he gave me has many issues. The 70,000 RMB quote does not include the cost of water and electricity improvement, or any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three items account for the largest portion of the basic cost.
Excluding the service points where they receive payments, their wages are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company. they didn't make things clear to me at the beginning and asked me to sign a contract.
When I went to ask them for refunds, they showed a professional approach, having specialized teams to deal with me.
Regardless of how it happens, it's the customer's problem. They hold no responsibility for it.
There are many ways to shirk responsibility, and there are a lot of details that make me teary-eyed, but the bottom line is don't choose them. My friend had them work on the renovation of their house and the quality was not good. They'll charge you a lot in the end for various expenses.
Bro, they were just fake bosses who tricked people before, now they're calling themselves "Big America," but it seems like they're bankrupt again and have changed into something else.
So everyone, please don't choose such low-end decoration companies.
In the future, everyone should check and consult these websites thoroughly when making a decision, as decoration is not a small matter.
To ask questions to merchants, please log in or register first.
It is forbidden to publish various forms of business reviews. For details, please refer to the merchant recruitment statement.
Dazhong Dianping (a popular review website) provides the latest merchant information, such as addresses, phone numbers, and business hours for decoration companies on the Kunming decoration design channel of 360 Integrated Home Decoration. (You can find decoration companies through Dazhong Dianping.)
This is terrible, please cancel the order if it cannot be delivered within 30 minutes!
Is there no other solution but to change one's address [i.e. move somewhere else]?
Alright, I won't end this conversation. If it takes 5-10 days and I don't get my money back, I will pursue it.
Can I cancel in 15 minutes? (This question is not directly related to the previous topic about talent and rural revitalization.) The answer would depend on the context. Some things may not be cancellable once initiated, while others may have a cancellation period. For example, a ticket purchase or a subscription often has a cancellation period within which you can cancel and receive a refund, but if that period has passed, the purchase or subscription becomes non-refundable. However, if the specific circumstances of the situation are not provided, it is impossible to give a definitive answer. If you could specify the context of your question, I may be able to give a more accurate answer.
Chicken talk should be familiar, but what was received was real meat, no choice but to eat it. This idiom suggests that people may have to accept unexpected or unfavorable situations despite their preferences.
The Pegasus constellation will have a major meteor shower on the night of the 14th - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News: The last major meteor shower of the year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Taurus Meteor Shower, will peak on December 14th. Those who love meteor showers can observe after midnight on that day. (By Zhou Junjian, Tianjin, December 12, 2022)
Beijing astronomy enthusiasts captured a meteor shower of the constellation Gemini, also known as the Twins, in Qinghai Province on December 13, 2018.
Most mothers of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the mother body of the Gemini meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminid meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini is the second known meteor shower not originating from a comet's debris. (Comets were previously believed to be the only source of meteors in the solar system.)
In Tianjin City, the Chinese Astronomical Society Vice President and astronomy popularizer Modifying Pavilion introduced that, just like in a New Year's Eve film, the Gemini meteor shower can be seen, appearing around the end of the year, and the "showtime" lasts from December 4th to the 17th.
The meteor shower known as the Leonid Meteor Shower is famous for its large and stable flow, and is often referred to as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the Orionid Meteor Shower and the Geminid Meteor Shower.
One notable feature of the Leo Minor constellation during the Canis Majoris meteor shower, which falls under the constellation of Gemini, is that the meteorites move relatively slowly, have rich colors, and there are many fire meteors. This makes it suitable for both visual observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Ms. Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin, took pictures of the Geminid meteor shower in Tianjin's Rizhao on December 13, 2020.
The meteorological forecast indicates that this year's Geminids meteor shower will occur around December 14, between 12 pm and 3 pm. The peak ZHR (Zenith Hourly Rate, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant is directly overhead) is expected to reach 150.
A recommendation index graph for the Gemini meteor shower.
Last year, the "Scattered Stars of Genius" in the constellation of Gemini left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini Star Shower will be affected by moonlight and its brilliance will be slightly diminished.
On the 14th, according to the lunar calendar, it will be the eleventh day of the eleventh month, with the phase coinciding with a waxing moon. The bright moonlight will affect observations. Fortunately, the moon will have set by the second half of the night, and the radiant points of the Alpha and Beta Gemini meteor shower will be raised at that time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the second half of the night when the moon has set, but remember to keep warm and prevent the cold.
How can we observe more meteors as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a high altitude and low light pollution place with a northern exposure in the countryside or in the suburbs instead. Then, be patient and wait until the moon has come down before conducting visual observations."
It's important to note that the meteor shower in the constellation of Gemini, known as the Geminid meteor shower, has strong radiation flowing in all directions. When observing, it's not necessary to constantly focus your gaze on the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower.
Friends who like photography and want to take stunning "meteor shower" pictures are advised to use wide-angle, large aperture lenses, set a high ISO, and open the largest aperture during shooting.
Considering stability and sustainability, the three pillars, backup batteries, and fast shutter cogs are indispensable.
Modifying Phoenix remindingly says:
What is the difference in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic should refer to cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs. The market position differences between laser TVs and CRT TVs are mainly as follows:
The first one, Laser TV focuses more on the large screen market.
Compared to the expanding market positioning of liquid crystal TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large screen market, or to put it another way, laser TVs are a product born for large screens.
Currently, the popular sizes of liquid crystal TVs are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while laser TVs have sizes generally over 75 inches, and the largest exceed 100 inches, fully meeting users' demands for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the market share and exports of Laser TVs have been increasing steadily, accounting for over 60% of sales in the 80-inch and above large-screen TV market.
According to forecasts from Zhongyidang, the sales growth of the laser television market in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing high-speed growth.
The excellent performance in the large screen market primarily owes to the outstanding showing of laser TV in terms of eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV using mirror reflection, the laser light source does not shine directly into the eyes, unlike the backlighting of liquid crystal TVs. The imaging process is closer to the natural conditions for object imaging, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
The lab of China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Saxi and the eye experts from Beijing Tiantan Hospital conducted strict comparison experiments of laser TV and LCD TV under the same condition for a large number of people, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data shows that laser TV indeed has strong eye protection features, and even has certain improving effects in specific aspects.
In an age where visual health is increasingly valued, laser TVs not only attract more users due to their eye health benefits, but also open up another market breakthrough for color TVs.
The second, focused more on the high-end market with laser TV.
Although the price of LCD TVs continues to decline, the price of laser TVs in the market is generally above ten thousand yuan, and the price increases as the size and brightness of the screen upgrade.
Why is a laser TV so expensive?
That makes perfect sense.
With the constant development of light sources and technology levels, laser television has many advantages that cannot be achieved by liquid crystal TVs and projectors.
Laser TV, using ultra-short focus projection technology, has a shorter projection distance compared to traditional projection equipment. It can provide a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, and only requires a small amount of space. Additionally, the host is small and compact, occupying very little area.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach over 2000 lumens.
Moreover, their power consumption is lower, hence lesser equipment damage, leading to a longer lifespan of the television.
Besides this, many high-end laser TV models also come equipped with true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and holographic screens, providing users with a more shocking visual and auditory experience.
Regarding the discussion on laser TV not being suitable for audiovisual players, it's not about fake demand. Rather, it's about refining the product based on quality and output-input ratio. Those who seek to balance the large screen and viewing environment may give it a try. Every event has its pros and cons. Just make a judgment after weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and beware of one-sided arguments.
A simple explanation, a wide-angle close-focus projector or laser TV, in order to adhere close to the screen, must use expensive wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors which do not conform to the best optical design.
To block some environmental light, a micro-structured Felicia veil is used, which is expensive. The price of an 80-inch one is roughly the same as that of a 65-inch liquid crystal TV.
There is one more thing. I really dislike it when projector vendors boast about anti-reflection for the eyes, but the light reflected onto the screen is still directly shining onto the eyes for us. You might reflection it onto the ceiling, but the eyes cannot see it. Even if you insist on buying a more serious liquid crystal television, the light on the TV screen is still "directly shone" onto the ceiling, isn't it?
Moreover, without the manson Screen's mirroring effect, it would be impossible for it to look like a projection screen.
The blind spot of high-gain screens (pixellated areas) is often ignored. Reflected light from certain angles directly into the eyes is what makes them unbearable.
The photographic art gallery for film and visual aesthetics has not yet opened its branches.
After setting a date on WeChat for reservation, the lady sent me available options, and she responded promptly to messages.
I visited the shop to look at their photography works previously, most of them were outdoor wedding photos which were very beautiful. The photography styles they used were also quite diverse.
After chatting with the sister that day, she patiently tried on two styles of clothing that I was hesitant about. We finally decided on the starting makeup look. Before the photographer takes the shots, they will set up some props and guide the poses, paying great attention to every detail.
However, since there wasn't clear communication about specific shooting ideas, what was captured may not have been what I had in mind, but it should still be good-looking. 😊😊 (Embarrassed smiley faces)
After taking good photos, the photographer helps you select them, shares post-processing styles, and it feels quite thoughtful.
A well-prepared piece will take about half a month [to be completed and] for effects to show. [
The second round of the banquet for photography enthusiasts ～ Nearly all the clothing at the scene can be selected for photographing.
In the end, she chose a black linen dress to try out a different style.
The entire filming process took around 2 hours. The photographer in charge of filming was my younger brother born in 1995. I felt that he was still a little green in terms of customer filming actions. I hope he can give more suggestions to me in the future. Overall, the filming process was quite enjoyable.
The photograph gallery of fine arts in film and television selection store replies.
You're already on the homepage, so let's take a look at Queenie here~
I went to the shop first and filled in my name and phone number. I then selected the clothes, and I tried on several sets with great patience. I finally chose the ones that suited me best and then spent a long time getting made up. The service attitude was good. They also taught me how to pose for the photos afterwards. The finished photos seemed the same as the original, I was quite satisfied with the result, even though they said it would take half a month to complete, but it was only finished in three to four days.
The environment is generally okay.
There are many options for clothing.
There are approximately three positions for make-up in a photographic studio.
[Service] Warm-hearted and meticulous.
Stylist are quite patient.
A photographer will teach you seriously about actions.
If not satisfied, a photographer would actively propose reshooting.
["Experience"] The eyelid design may be a bit exaggerated, making it look like I have three eyelids instead of two.
The eyebrows have been shaved off, which feels a bit awkward for those who don't usually draw them on in their daily life.
Despite having photos for more than ten days, I am not satisfied with the P-shape effect, and I still feel that the double eyelids created by the tape are quite visible.
Because I wasn't clear on what style I wanted, I tried two sets. In the end, I chose the black formal dress. The woman said, "This set is more classic and retro."
After choosing the right outfit, I started getting made up and having my hair done by the patient hairstylist and makeup artist sisters. The results were very satisfying.
After getting my makeup and hair done, I started taking photos. The photographer gave me directions for every pose, and the process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking several photos, the little brother seriously chose four favorites for retouching. He said they would be done in 15 minutes and was very satisfied with the results.
I have not received a reply in the past 3 days.... Because your system cannot identify my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The most strange thing is that I have used the same credit card for every payment I have made.
I have to pay shipping fees every time.
Can I be excused from payment first, and then be billed once your investigation is complete? Is that acceptable?
 buying an umbrella for small rain, reliable enough?
Small Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the conditions set: According to the suggestions in the "Regulations on the Administration of Insurance Agencies (2015 Revision)," to set up an insurance agency company, one must meet three key requirements: have shareholders, no major legal violations in the past three years, a minimum registered capital of RMB 500 million, and must be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
These three items are quite stringent, in summary, one must have the ability, obtain approval from the national regulatory authority for insurance companies and banks (the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission), and have good conduct among stockholders. For the small rain umbrella insurance company, the insured parties do not need to overly question whether it is a legitimate insurance company or not, given these three barriers, not every insurance company can meet these requirements.
In this regard, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
From looking at insurance products: Small Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance plans are sold on this platform, like the latest launched Thai Mary 5 Super Critical Illness Insurance, with both the insurance company and the reinsurer being Thai Life Insurance. Small Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, and there's no need to question its reliability.
From a payment mode perspective, the products on internet platforms have a relatively high price-performance ratio because they save on business operation fees and labor costs for sales personnel. The payment methods are flexible, allowing for monthly payments and reducing the payment pressure on insured individuals. At the same time, this can maximize the leverage effect of insurance.
That's a good point.
It can be considered.
From the perspective of sales personnel: This is particularly important because the insurance industry demands a high level of professionalism. Many internet products can be self-insured by customers, leading to misunderstandings in terms of health status and occupation. When sales personnel are involved in the insurance process, they often inject their own subjective judgment, leading to potential claims issues and the risk of rejection.
I used to work in "Tencent Weibaos" (similar to Xiaoyanpan, it's an internet insurance sales platform), and I can tell you responsibly.
The insurance offered by the internet is real, but trustworthiness depends on people, not the internet. Unprofessional salespeople in the online insurance channels can lead to misinformation.
for instance, "1 yuan insurance covering 600,000 yuan, buying insurance to get a phone, receiving 6 million yuan of critical illness coverage for free," these marketing strategies are not incorrect, but they tend to overlook the facts, and they don't tell the policyholders that the first month is 1 yuan, but subsequent months require regular payment, which could be several tens to hundreds of yuan, many customers pay for several years but they still don't understand what exactly they've bought.
One might think that insurers could pay out 600 million yuan for just a 1 yuan premium (a reference to the saying "drop the bun for ten cents"), but it's not that simple in reality.
Getting a free phone: It's only given out for specific insurance policy numbers like 6666 or 8888, and if you win, you will receive a message but no one will remind you if you don't claim it.
(This is another pitfall for policyholders). Getting a 60,000 RMB critical illness insurance coverage for free may only be a short-term solution. If there are no other commercial insurances and a critical illness occurs, the 60,000 RMB will not be enough to cover the costs, and their future life will be left bare.
Currently, the state is severely cracking down on misleading practices in online insurance sales.
In summary, the platform and products are not the problems. The issues lie with the professionalism and work ethics of the salespeople.
I suggest that the topic poster carefully consider the comprehensive situation, in fact, many offline insurance company products are more extensive, and the Customer has more choices and opportunities, some products have a better cost-effectiveness compared to internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers myself, undertaking offline product guarantees, saving each person approximately 2000-3000 yuan per year in fees.
If everyone has any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me.
I: I am an insurance broker at Mingyao Insurance, with over three years of experience in enterprise training. I have served over a thousand enterprise users, and have cooperated with over a hundred insurance companies. Before insurance policies are purchased, I focus on the needs of the customers and tailor-make insurance products for them. During the purchasing process, I compare quotes from three companies and strive to secure the best reinsurance results for the customers. After the policies are purchased, I handle the policy paperwork organization, and insurance policy management to give customers peace of mind.
Growing with every customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, internet insurance refers to insurance business transactions in which the insured party can self-complete all insurance application procedures by clicking on the insurance purchase link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor also does not need to sign. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the insurance purchasing process on the internet has less of a "ceremonial feel" and may even lack a printed paper contract, this in no way affects the validity or legal effect of an electronic contract.
This model is similar to the "telemarketing" assembly line job in some ways, but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way—the after-sales service may not keep up.
When buying insurance, we should seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is someone who can accompany us for many decades and still provide us with services in the years to come.
To contact a meals delivery employee, you need to know their contact information, such as their phone number or online ID. If you don't have it, you can try contacting the restaurant or organization that employs them, or check if there is any availabilty for customers to leave a message for the employee through their delivery platform.
It's almost 3 pm.
That's not about compensation for you.

But the horseman was only left at the door, and then the people just left.
Misplaced.
Your rider has already picked up my order number #NUMBER# for takeout, but they have notified me that I am still waiting.

After I finish buying, do you want other takeout?
What can be done?
Your jockey went where?
Do we still have to wait?
I am here to deliver an order.

There's no problem. Remember, there's no need to arrange for a return, I have already purchased another one instead, I don't want to waste it.
You're welcome!
From past to present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and ridicule. I cannot accept such behavior involving personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate all things, but we must oppose such savagery.
If we ignore the party and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized habit.
Starting from your sending friend requests on Facebook, following by posting satirical posts, and up to your attempting to publish my supposed home location and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude towards you.
I have been relentlessly tagged by you beyond the one-per-day-six-meals frequency. Furthermore, on Facebook, you continue to openly discuss some ambiguous, embarrassing statements about me among your so-called friends. There are comments regarding my appearance, physique, kindness, and even bedside vegetable gardening and insertions. I…well, never mind.
Later, I received several messages from my Facebook friends who sent me a photo of you and inappropriate comments in your friend's circle.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became more and more boisterous.
I don't care about your political background or social status. In our society, respect for both men and women is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with your sarcasmic, mysterious, embarrassing, and mocking remarks. You can also continue insisting that you're just expressing love and concern for me. You can even continue denying that the pictures weren't made by you or continuing to post attacking remarks.
That's correct, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and have no intention of getting to know you. Your opinion of my appearance and physique is neither solicited nor necessary.
I don't even believe that there would be any girl who would willingly let someone embarrass herself in such a way to gain fame.
A friend asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said so, but you still won't believe me.
I think no girl would be able to say she's fine after being bullied in such a way.
Regardless of whether it's in work, society, politics, or business, only those who lack even basic morals will choose to harm any woman using such methods.
I believe that justice is inherent in the human heart.
I have cut out some comments for everyone to critique.
Your own post shouldn't be able to be impersonated by others, right?
I can only say you are an enemy of civilization. (Sarcastically or in a joking manner)
Smiling in agreement.
Vietnam People's Voice Online: Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprises Development Forum
During the third National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum in Vietnam, two major conferences were held with topics centered around digital technology enterprises and the national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and the economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic as the two main themes.
The minister of the Information and Communications Department of Vietnam, Ruan Xiong, stated that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of COVID-19, the number and business revenues of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth trend, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam saw the production of numerous typical digital products, addressing many of the country's major issues, with many digital products making their way out of the country, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking improving significantly.
Xiuming Hu, minister, calls on digital technology companies to assume the responsibility of developing the national digitalization transformation platforms and consider it as a national mission.
On forums, leaders of departments and national organizations have shared their efforts, development, application, and transfer of digital technology in enterprises, organizations, and individuals. They are mobilizing and pooling social resources to develop Vietnam's technological enterprises, working hand in hand to drive the national digital transformation, and proposing breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-epidemic economic recovery in China.
Premier Li Keqiang, in a speech at a forum, emphasized that digital transformation is the inevitable path for the world and a necessary requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and since it aims to serve all people, it requires that all people participate.
The people and enterprises are the core, subject, target, and driving force for digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the benefit of the people and enterprises.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang emphasized that the digital transformation should reflect national spirit, and it should be led by our own strengths, with a strategic, long-term, and decisive nature, while external forces are important and serve as breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation should drive deep development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of COVID-19 pneumonia, economic recovery and development, respond to changes after the epidemic, and overcome the problem of exhaustion of natural resources. It will help promote green transformation and development of green energy sources.
During the digital transformation process, efforts are needed to participate in building databases for protecting and promoting the value of national culture, historical traditions, national circumstances, and other related aspects. This will accelerate the digitization of banks, taxation, land management and development, and logistics sectors, among others.
The greatest goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang has called on all levels of government, organizations, and enterprises to intensify leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhanced understanding of digital transformation, continued formulation and improvement of digital transformation systems, and to strengthen administrative capabilities, all while adhering to a respectful, communicative, proactive, and responsive spirit to encourage the development of digital technology companies.
During the forum, Premier Lan Jianjun attended the awarding ceremony and the opening ceremony of the Digital Product Exhibition for Excellent Vietnamese-made Products in 2021.
I have reported and attached the images, but there has been no response.
What kind of cow is that, it doesn't even look like a cow.
It is a colloquial expression meaning a hollow promise or an empty talk followed by action lacking substance, like promising something but not delivering. In this context, it seems unrelated to the previous discussion about talent and rural revitalization.
I'm just a text-based AI, I don't have the ability to eat. However, the phrase "没办法吃" (měi bàn wǒ chī) in Chinese means "I have no choice but to eat" or "I have to eat this."
Are you serving fresh food, not old?
unacceptable (adj.): not acceptable or agreeable; not approved or sanctioned by someone.
It has been ordered early in the morning.
"He said he would send it over at around 7:30."
Why do we need to remake [something]?
That's ridiculous.
The "Zhihe Hunan Changxiang" 2021 China International Track Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit was held - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online)
The "Smart Hunan Xiangxiang" 2021 China International Space Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit kicked off in Zhuzhou on the 9th. (Full media reporter Zhou Zheng)
Wang Cheng, a member of the provincial committee and head of the organizational department of the provincial committee, attended the launching ceremony and made a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central People's Congress on Human Resources Work and the 12th Provincial Party Congress in Hunan, which showcases the serious attitude and eagerness of Hunan towards talent, and the good use of talent.
In Hunan, there is a good tradition of valuing and respecting the educated. It has become a broad platform for talent development and a place for realizing a beautiful life. In recent years, it has deeply implemented the talent-led development strategy and used the "Peach Blossom Talent Action Plan" to build a talent attraction, retention, and utilization full-chain human resources work system. It has become the nurturing land, an incubator for innovation and entrepreneurship, and a living and working paradise for talents.
Currently, Hunan is fully implementing the "Three Highs and Four New" strategic positioning and mission, opening its doors wider for talent, and rolling out more favorable policies for innovation and entrepreneurship, concentrating more resources, and creating better conditions. We look forward to more excellent talents joining hands with Hunan for its high-quality development.
At the scene of the activity, pavilions were set up in Changsha, Chuzhou, and Xiangtan of Hunan Province, and the Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, Provincial Labor and Social Security Department, and Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department released lists of key demand for advanced manufacturing industry technologies and innovation, the talent demand catalog for intelligent manufacturing industry, and the talent demand catalog for doctoral students in intelligent manufacturing industry at the doctoral talent exchange station.
F Forty-eight large enterprises in China, including China National Heavy Duty Truck Group, China Communications Construction Group, and Far East Tech, have recruited on-site, with over a thousand related graduates and social talents participating in the talent project interface.
Hello there!
I just placed an order and the delivery person is shown as waiting at the restaurant on the app, but the restaurant says the order is ready and I haven't seen the delivery person.
Of course, I'll be happy to help follow up on that. Thank you for your patience.
It is possible to be late by half an hour without reason.
Well, I don't have a solution to the specific issue of where to find talent for rural revitalization, but I can suggest some possibilities based on the context provided. One solution could be to encourage and support returning rural migrant workers to contribute their skills and knowledge back to their hometowns. This was the focus of the Xinhua commentary I provided an earlier translation of. Other possibilities include attracting college graduates to rural areas through incentives and policies, and developing vocational training programs to equip the local population with the skills needed for modern agriculture and rural industries.

A high-speed rail station in one's hometown.
Address: No. 555, Beijing Side of the North Railway (Look up the map)
This place has complete household appliances, with many brands, and all well-known brands available.
On the Twelfth Night, at "Hansen water purifier" shop, I saw the price was quite favorable as they were having an activity.
Surprisingly, a house has 11 floors. The bottom two floors and the floor below ground level are used as parking areas, and parking is even free during the day!
The surrounding area is not very appealing, with very few restaurants and five-star stores, and the taste of the restaurants is mediocre.
This elevator is really incomprehensible. It's like having a major illness, constantly bouncing between the negative second and negative first floors. press the button for this floor repeatedly, but I cannot get out at the floor where the security channel leads to the first floor. Instead, I end up in a furniture store, a furniture store that is closed, and I cannot get out through the security channel!
Even in the "Home of Amazing People," there is still room for improvement, and there are many areas that have not been developed yet.
Address: No. 555, Jingjiang North Road, Sanyisui Town, Saviyakur District, Traffic is convenient, the parking lot is very large, and it's free during the day.
Environment: The truth is that there are many layers, up to eight or nine, in the store. There are all kinds of furniture, home appliances, and various small items that you can buy. Many well-known brands have set up shop inside, such as Tusi, European style, Hanxing, Lord, Peakcreat, Hanson, Yadan, and so on. The brands are really too numerous to mention. It's a great place to buy products. You can rest in the sofa when you're tired of shopping.
Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa. A friend told me there are many sofas to choose from over here. I looked at Huaqiaohui Furniture and Meike Furniture, and I found them decent, but the prices are a bit high, so I am still indecisive.

The Longjiang Ganliu Realizes Full Coverage of Waterborne Green Comprehensive Service Zones - Xinhuanet
Xinhua: The Chongqing Municipal Tfuling Waterfront Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was put into operation on the 10th as scheduled, making it the second water-based comprehensive service area to officially operate in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Tianfu Green Waterfront Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province went online on the 8th.
Up to now, the water-based comprehensive service areas have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The deputy director of the River Transportation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, Mr. Qiu Jianhua, introduced that before, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces had built and operated 10 green comprehensive service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. These areas have received broad recognition from ship crews, and have played an important role in promoting high-quality development of Yangtze River transportation.
The full coverage of waterborne green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event in the construction of the Long River Green Transportation, leading to significant improvements in the reception of river shipping pollution and the capacity of transportation services.
According to the introduction, a water-based green comprehensive service area is a facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for a large number of ships and crew, helping to address the "urgent needs and longing" issues for many seafarers.
During this construction, two waterfront green comprehensive service areas have been built on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating living services, production services, and administrative services into one body, with green and environmentally-friendly themes, and specializing in ship maintenance and emergency rescue services for vessels. This will enable passengers and cargo ships that frequently travel on the Yangtze River to work more efficiently and have a more convenient living experience.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China: The strongest U.S. weapon rarely visits Guam, sending significant signals to allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. (Reported by Duowei, a pro-Chinese media outlet, on January 17, 2022)
According to the information from the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Initiative," on January 9, a satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" in the South China Sea near the Babulamak Bay.
The Malacca Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Suez Canal, is a strategic location on the first island chain of the western Pacific Ocean.
The "Carl-Filson" carrier is predicted to deploy to the South China Sea on this platform.
The "Carl V. Johnson" aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" transport planes for the first time.
Apart from the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier currently operating in the Pacific, there is also the "Abraham Lincoln" carrier that set sail from the US on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" aircraft carrier has for the first time carried the F-35C squadron, which belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron.
Besides the two aircraft carriers mentioned earlier, the US Navy has a carrier, the "Ronald Reagan" (USS Ronald Reagan), deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
In an aircraft carrier strike group, there are also the "Shanghu Lake" cruiser and the "Stockdale" destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Perception Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathered near China.
(@SouthChinaStrategyTactics) The U.S. three aircraft carriers gather in the waters near China. The most powerful weapon, the CMV-22B transport aircraft, rarely visits Guam on January 17, 2022.
According to a report by CNN, the US Navy on January 17, 2023, the United States, one of the most powerful weapons in its weapons depot on Guam, made a rare visit.
The Russian nuclear-powered submarine "Internalya, or Nevada," carrying 20 three-pronged torpedo-guided missiles and dozens of nuclear warhead tips entered the US Naval Base in Pearl Harbor last Saturday (January 15th).
The presence of three US aircraft carriers in the South China Sea amid increasing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region is seen as a signal to friends and foes alike. The most powerful weapon aboard these carriers seldom makes public appearances at US bases, underscoring the growing importance of this region.
This is the first visit by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second open visit since the 1980s.
The US three aircraft carriers gather around China: The most powerful weapon seldom visits Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea over the past few years.
This is a map of Yongshu Island in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy stated in a declaration that the "North Dakota" nuclear-powered submarine of the Dyagilev level visited Guam this time, strengthening the cooperation between the United States and the allied regional countries, displaying the U.S. capability, adaptability, combat readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of 14 "Threat Hunter" submarines in the US Navy fleet are generally kept deeply secret.
 The "Leiying Submarine" surrounded by ballistic missile-carrying submarines becomes the "most important survival weapon" in the "triad" of China's nuclear forces. This system also includes missile silos on American soil, as well as B-2 and B-52 bombers capable of carrying nuclear bombheads.
Discussing with friends about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and the loss of $25.1 billion in market value. Zuckerberg responded with "facing unprecedented competition." What could be the reasons?
Meta, formerly Facebook, is essentially an advertising company. Its main income comes from advertising. It is a profitable advertising company that has its own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on are all traffic channels for Meta, regardless of their functional positions.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "ad alliance". Many apps monetize through Meta's ad platform by interfacing with Meta's ads.
But the times have changed.
First, due to Apple's adjustment to its privacy policy, Meta finds it difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of ad delivery.
Apple's current privacy policy is quite user-friendly, it will clearly notify users whether they allow an App to access their own information. The normal reaction of most people is to reject it.
If Google stabs again in the future, Meta's income will be affected even more significantly.
The second reason is that the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has weakened (The exact proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Most people know that Meta doesn't have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, Meta contributes at least 10% of its income from companies based in China that conduct their business there.
Meta has around a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office, and several large representatives in the mainland.
Chinese companies looking to expand overseas markets cannot bypass Meta as an advertising channel, and most of their money goes to Meta.
It's worth noting that ByteDance's TikTok is currently one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta managed to earn a significant amount of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Domestic agencies are helping ByteDance (CharByte) to advertise in the Meta (Facebook) Greater China region, and the performance of Meta in this region is quite good.
Recently, I haven't specifically learned about it, but it's definitely not better than before.
China's companies have already passed the phase of large-scale spending overseas.
The third one is the expansion of new channels for traffic is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms like TikTok are not under Meta's control.
The biggest problem is not just a drop in income, but the lack of growth prospects.
The capital market doesn't just look at current income, but more importantly, it looks at the future expectations.
It is quite clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Mark Zuckerberg talked about "the metaverse."
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is quite long. This story may not be able to support Meta's market value in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years are expected to be more challenging for Meta.
Despite Facebook's impressive image on social media with annual income of over $1 trillion to $2 trillion, the company is actually facing a high degree of risk. Compared to other Internet companies and high-tech firms, it has no significant secure barriers.
Despite having several popular social software with high daily active users, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, there's little confidence for Facebook in the face of TikTok's rapid development. The overthrow could just take a blink of an eye.
Mark Zuckerberg's attempts at the concept of "The Metaverse" are unlikely to succeed in the short term, making Facebook's current situation rather dangerous. This is the reason why Zuckerberg keeps changing company names and constantly looks for new arenas. However, in my opinion, his choice of competition areas is incorrect and a dead-end. The above are some of my thoughts, for your reference.

If an entire box of "chicken with mouthwatering sauce" turns out to be chicken without bones or edible meat, is it possible to get a refund?
I'm sorry, I cannot directly translate this Chinese text into English as it seems to contain specific content related to a hashtag #PRS\_ORG# and a specific amount of money #NUMBER#. It could be a comment or post on social media about missing out on certain foods during a Prince Talent Contest (PRS\_ORG) and the disappointment of not receiving a refund of #NUMBER# yuan. Without more context or information, it cannot be accurately translated. However, I can suggest possible meanings based on the provided text: "Bananas, egg tofu, and buns haven't arrived yet, [at the Prince Talent Contest event], #PRS\_ORG# I refunded #NUMBER# yuan." or "I missed out on bananas, egg tofu, and buns worth #NUMBER# yuan at the Prince Talent Contest [event] #PRS\_ORG#."
Regarding refunds for "chicken that talks but does not lay eggs," the specifics would depend on the terms and conditions of the purchase or contract involved. It's important to refer to relevant consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as the agreement between the buyer and seller. To determine whether a refund is possible, consider factors such as the nature of the product or service, the reason for its unsatisfactory performance, and the applicable refund policies. Consult with relevant authorities or legal experts if needed.
Because being born here doesn't ensure food on the table.
If you want to cancel, yes, you can. However, I will stop providing responses based on Chinese text you provide once the request is cancelled. Is there anything specific you'd like me to help you with before cancelling?
China-Laos Joint Military "Peaceful Rescue-2021" Drill Concludes Successfully - Xinhuanet
On December 12, 2021, at the South China Sea, the Chinese contingent of the "Peaceful Rescue-2021" joint exercise between Chinese and Vietnamese militaries safely returned to the Chinese mainland in Guangxi after completing a seven-day training task. (Xinhua News Agency, Zhou Na and Teng Huajin)
In this joint drill, China and Vietnam focused on the major topic of humanitarian medical aid under the banner of humanitarianism. This was closely related to their mission of emergency relief and first aid. They completed the subjects of united command, united on-site rescue, and mass casualty treatment according to the standards of practical application, effectively enhancing the ability of the two militaries to provide medical assistance.
The results of the exercise were approved by the Chinese and Vietnamese military.
Ruan Xiongshan, chairman of the Laos Exercises Preparatory Committee, deputy chief of the Laos People's Army Logistics Bureau, and political commissar, spoke at the closing ceremony of the exercises, saying that through this exercise, the Lao military medical team learned about organizing exercises and professional activities from Chinese military medical personnel, and saw the medical and supporting equipment of the Chinese side.
The results of the drills prove the professional capabilities of the medical forces of the two countries in medical aid and epidemic control.
Chen Chunming, director of the coordination group of the Chinese leading group and deputy director of the medical bureau of the Central Military Commission's Logistics Support Department, stated that this exercise is an innovation and practice built on the success of the joint medical aid activity held in 2018, and it has significant milestone significance.
During the drills, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, rapid nucleic acid testing equipment, and other healthcare anti-epidemic supplies to the Vietnam People's Army.
