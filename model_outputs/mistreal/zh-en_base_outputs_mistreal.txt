Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such things from happening again.
Maybe the restaurant needs more time to get ready. I can help you ask if you have the contact information.
Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting: Students Sing as Lead Actors, Research Findings Open Up New Perspectives - Xinhuanet
Yesterday evening, at the academic annual meeting of Zhejiang University in 2016, a series of academic achievements that seemed to come from out of nowhere were awarded recognition. These ideas included using air to wash hands, diagnosing diseases by examining one's breath, and precisely locating sources of fog.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research spanned across fields such as environment, mechanism, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. Starting from a curious seed, they have created many high-end inventions of practical value. Some projects have already been awarded domestically and internationally.
A biological sensor: Your family doctor at home
The research team of PhD student Zhang Diming from the School of Biomedical, Medical Engineering, and Technology presented an intelligent biosensor the size of half a smartphone at the scene.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, this instrument can preliminarily detect your health status from the components of the air you exhale."
Zhang Di introduced that this sensor, connected to an intelligent phone, will display health reports after blowing out the air.
A smartwatch on the market can detect health conditions, but it usually only measures physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor applies the new material of graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect one's physical health status.
Intelligent surgical lamp: The high-power eyes of doctors.
Besides smartphones, intelligent surgical lamps have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th International Invention Exhibition in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, this year.
Master's students Zhu Linjiao and Shulin Fei from the College of Optoelectronics and Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University started a new approach in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps, inventing an intelligent LED surgical lamp with no shadow.
"Many diseases are not diagnosed early enough or completely removed due to the lighting in the operating room of doctors."
Apil Jinfei said, for example, if a doctor cannot clearly identify all the tumor tissue during early cancer screening, cancer cells may continue to spread afterwards.
This type of intelligent surgical light has four lamp discs. The degree of contrast between different tissues under the lighting is enhanced by adjusting the light spectrum.
During surgery, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectral distribution, color uniformity, and imagelessness of the scan at will based on the surgical requirements and personal habits.
This type of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in the Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, among other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention received the first-place award in the National Science and Technology competition.
Using air to wash hands: water-saving and cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands by using water to rinse, at most rubbing some soap and hand sanitizer. But Li Qiangzhao and his peers invented an "air-cleaning hand sanitizing device".
Standing at a soap dispenser will compress the air around us, making us lighter as soon as we weigh ourselves. (This statement is not scientifically accurate, as weight is determined by the mass of an object and the force of gravity pulling upon it, not by the amount of air compressed around it.)
"It's like blowing up a balloon."
The compressed air, when released, forms a liquid at the faucet and combines with water.
With that, we can wash our hands clean of it!
Colorimetric reactions and bacterial residue experiments have shown that this method of washing hands is just as effective as the ordinary way of washing hands.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring cleanliness and saving 90% of water in the process. The entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving, and eco-friendly.
Last year, at the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and received the only golden award.
Please arrange for the return as soon as possible, thank you.
Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points. I will not use #PRS\_ORG# again in the future!
Bones and spicy stinky tofu are not suitable for children to eat.
If it is a request to order something, please do so as soon as possible.
There isn't an answer for that question at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you about his position using the hashtag #PRS\_ORG#.
I gave up, canceled the order.
I bought it, but I wrote down the wrong address. #PRS\_ORG# refers to a specific organization or entity, but without further context it's unclear which one.
Yes, it can be changed.
Or cancel the order.
Sure, I'm here to help. Let me provide some context regarding the topic of the Chinese articles you've shared.
I find it very meaningful to have a certificate of first aid.
This is one important skills certificate besides my driving license!
Let me clarify: Emergency measures, in fact, refer to first aid procedures taken before an ambulance arrives, during a sudden emergency situation.
As is well known, there is still a significant amount of time between when an emergency occurs and when an ambulance arrives. It is during this critical time that matters most.
This is a time when urgent help is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, a stroke, or a breathing stoppage, our window of life would only be four minutes, the "golden four minutes"!
That's why knowing how to rescue those around you is so important!
When someone collapses next to us, we can use professional knowledge to perform CPR on them, instead of standing there helplessly and being unable to do anything, which is a terrifying feeling.
"In China, every year there are unexpectedly three hundred thousand deaths in our official data, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest."
Approximately 15% of the population in the United States can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70-80% can be saved, but less than 1% in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is what the first-generation founder Lu Le said as a first reaction.
 if a person has had a sudden cardiac arrest and has stopped breathing, and their heartbeat has stopped, giving them chest compressions will have no effect.
It is only through artificial respiration and external compressions that a person can be revived.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid these days. But in case of an emergency, it's too late. I would like to urge everyone to learn this skill. By doing so, we can react in a timely manner when faced with unexpected situations.
Perhaps it can even save a person's life!
You can register for first aid training at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts as well.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25. Adding an emergency certificate to the list of goals was also something I did a few months ago, and I actually accomplished it!
I'm going to take other certifications next, I plan to take a scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a scuba diving first aid certification, it seems like you need to have the first aid certification to take the scuba diving certification exam, so in fact, the first aid certification is quite useful!
I have ordered #Number#
One 13 yuan shui zhu shui jiao (steamed shrimp dumpling) only?
I haven't tried that.
Why doesn't #NAME# make it clear?
One costs 13 yuan? I'm unable to understand this question in its current form as it seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide more context or clarify the question?
Yesterday, #PRS\_ORG# accidentally sent me food, and now it's only giving me a shrimp dumpling?！？
Because I saw that the code I entered before was effective.
First, I'd like to state my personal opinion that the movie "Four Seas" is a complete flop from all aspects.
Although you may say that this movie is not a highlight, at least the background music selection is quite good.
A badge of many kinds, one that makes you drowsy and comfortable in the cinema, another that makes you angry and filled with righteous indignation after watching it, the movie "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Huangshan for audiences. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is indeed a pure talent in terms of disrespecting the audience.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it feels like a fabricated work in the style of a Chekhov novel, with an unclear identity and numerous loopholes, just like a cheap denim jacket on a Small Soldier character.
After watching it, you may even suspect that there are hidden metaphors in it by the director. But after careful thought, you'll find out that it's just a pile of manure.
Let me first explain some parts that I have difficulty understanding.
The main character's place of residence should be a Southern island, and he should be closely dependent on his grandma.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so a neighbor, who was a kind old man, offered to take her on his small bakery cart to the northeast to fulfill her wish. The scene was arranged accordingly in the plot.
An elderly person observing snow from a bread wagon, traveling from the south to the northeast? It seems unlikely as bread wagons have been largely replaced by more modern forms of transport, and it's an unusual mode of transportation for a long-distance journey. The context of this statement is unclear without additional information.
He and his father are quite reassured about this.
Then this old man had no more text left.
Opening a restaurant on an abandoned cargo ship, how did the female lead and her brother obtain the business license? This question seemingly relates to a specific plot in a movie or a story and I would need more context to provide a satisfactory answer. If you could provide the title or the name of the work, it would be helpful. In general, the procedures and requirements for obtaining a business license can vary depending on the industry, location, and specific regulations, so it would need to be addressed case by case.
Why can the rowdy members of the "Island Planes Party" easily block a mountain path with just a few planes?
Then a cement truck right in the middle of the road came to a halt, and the drivers of all the surrounding trucks couldn't find any steel bars (implying that the cement truck was stuck without steel bars).
This tool's function is quite obvious, isn't it?
Why would a small thug with a poor credit record and suspicion of law violations become a police auxiliary?
In the face of high-interest loans, why didn't the police report it in reality, and why did the cops even ask if there were any difficult situations in the movie?
A grown-up person who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room keycard in a hotel, then arranges for someone to find the hotel manager who's not available, and ends up sleeping outside the room?
The whole movie is filled with bizarre situations that make no sense. Recalling them brings me sadness due to their implausibility.
Excluding the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or to put it bluntly, the movie has no theme at all, just a Frankenstein monster of a production.
At the beginning of the movie, you may think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational movie. Midway through, you think it's about the difficult lives of small-town young people, but when you finish watching it, you're left in deep reflection, wondering why you went to the cinema during New Year's Day to watch something irrelevant.
For most people, these movie plots are quite familiar. For instance, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle mechanic, you'll begin with an inspirational and comic episode, then tell the audience about an untalented novice who gradually achieves success.
If you want to shoot a love story, you'd better stick to the romantic entanglements of a young man from the old town who loves motorcycles and a waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at least the plot in your story shouldn't contradict the normal world.
(For example, the role of the new motorcycle owner who was burnt but still managed to sing in Xin Yanzi's play), it is better not to come up with ideas that are as clichéd as those that even Khan Noonien Singh would find weak.
As for the female lead, who was clearly not slow-witted, but acted like a 5-year-old in certain aspects, I don't know if it was intentional acting or the director's requirement.
I still don't quite understand one thing: Why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so eager to add racing collision scenes in his own movies?
Arranging such a movie in the Chinese New Year film lineup, is it to block the audience's enjoyment?
