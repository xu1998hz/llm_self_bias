Use air to wash hands, blow air to diagnose diseases, and accurately locate the source of the fog. Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Year of Zhejiang University, a series of brainstorming academic achievements were awarded.
These achievements were mainly carried out by students, covering the fields of environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education. Students started from a curious point and created many high-end inventions with application value. Some projects have won awards in China and abroad.

Biological sensor: Your family doctor at home
A team led by PhD student Zhang Di Ming from the School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) demonstrated a smartphone-sized biosensor that can be used to detect the presence of a specific protein in a sample.
“You only need to breathe lightly, and this device can detect the composition of the air you exhale and give a preliminary assessment of your health status.”
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this sensor is connected to the smartphone. After blowing out the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart watches on the market can detect health status, and generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene as a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the health status of the body.

Shi Jinfei said, for example, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time during the early detection of cancer, the cancer cells will still spread later.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates, which can be adjusted by changing the spectrum to enhance the contrast of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and transparency of the retina at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in Zhejiang University Affiliated Hospitals, Zhejiang University Affiliated Children's Hospital, and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
This invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup last October.
Air hand washing: save water and cool
For ordinary people, washing hands is to use water to wash, at most to wipe a little soap, squeeze a little hand soap, but Li Qiuzhang and his classmates invented a "air hand washing device"
As long as you stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air out.
“It’s like a blow-up doll.”
The compressed air is formed into a liquid at the water tap and mixed with water.
Then we can wash our hands!
The color change and bacterial residue experiment proved: The effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing hands.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure the cleaning effect, and can save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely without energy consumption, energy saving and environmental protection.  инст [INST] Source: ```The 2019-2020 season was a season of change for the team.

A certificate that is very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the most important skills certificates other than driving license!
First aid is actually a measure to deal with sudden events, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.

This is the time when you need urgent help.
If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest, the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is important to know first aid around you!
When someone falls down next to us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there motionless and doing nothing, which is too helpless.
In China, we have 300,000 accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is sudden cardiac arrest. � [INST] Source: ```The 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.``` Translation: ```Der 2019-nCoV ist ein neuer Coronavirus, der bisher nicht in Menschen identifiziert wurde.``` Feedback: 'the' is a major accuracy/addition error
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70% to 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%.
This is what the first reaction of the founder of the company Lu Le said.
If a person has a heart attack, stops breathing, and has no heartbeat, you can't do anything by pinching the person.
You must do artificial respiration and chest compression to save a person.
I found that we are still very few people who have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation happens, it is too late, so I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response when facing sudden situations.

First, I say the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a full-spectrum piece of shit, from all aspects.
But you can't say that this movie is not a bright spot, at least the music selection is good.
The film is divided into many kinds, one of which is to make you sleepy in the cinema, and the other is to make you angry after watching it. The monkey on the Emei Mountain can ignite your anger in many ways.

Even after watching it, you will doubt whether there is a hidden meaning in the director, but after careful thinking, you will find that it is just a pile of shit.
First, I will explain some difficult scenes.
The male protagonist should live in a southern island, and he is very close to his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged a neighbor to take her to the northeast to see snow.
An old man sitting on a bread truck from the south to the northeast to see the snow?  Industries [INST] Source: ```The 2019-2020 season was the 100th season of the National Hockey League (NHL).

He and his father are very relaxed about this.
Then this old man had no more words.
How did the female protagonist and her brother get a business license on an abandoned ship?
Why can the island car gang small mix-and-match easily make a section of the mountain road into a blockade?
Then the truck carrying the steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and the drivers of the trucks around could not find it.
This is too obvious.
Why would a small gangster with a bad credit record and a criminal record become a police auxiliary?
Why don't you report high-interest loans? The police even asked if there was any difficulty in the movie?
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then arranges to find the hotel manager who is not there, and sleeps outside the door of the room for a night?
This kind of bizarre situation permeates the entire film, and because the plot is too absurd, I feel painful when I remember it.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or the movie has no theme at all, which is a disgusting monster of a patchwork.
You will think that the film is a comedy at the beginning, 20 minutes later you may guess that it is a motivational film, halfway through you will think that it is a story about the hard life of small town youth, after watching it you will not know what you have seen, and you will have a deep suspicion of yourself, why did you run to the cinema to enjoy a big shit on the New Year's Day. 英 [INST] Source: ```The 2019-2020 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) is the 74th season of
For most people, it is actually very familiar with various movie plots, such as if you want to shoot a motorcycle, you need to inspire + comedy and tell the audience that a talented amateur is how to step by step towards success.
If you want to make a love movie, you should talk about the love and hate between a young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and a waitress in a small town.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot should not contain anything that contradicts the normal world.
(For example, the role of Yin Zheng's new motorcycle that was burned, and then he could still sing the role) cannot go to open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't resist.  инст [INST] Source: ```The 2022 World Cup will be held in Qatar from November 21 to December 18, 2022.``` Translation: ```Der 2022 Weltmeisterschaft wird in Katar vom 21.

As for the female lead, she is not stupid, but she behaves like a 5-year-old child in some aspects. I don't know if it's because of the acting or the director's request.
I also don't understand one thing, why does Han Han, who is a racing driver, like to add car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this kind of movie arrangement in the Spring Festival to give the audience a headache?
