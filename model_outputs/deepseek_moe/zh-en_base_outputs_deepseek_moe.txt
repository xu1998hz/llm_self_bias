Is there a way to punish him
To avoid such incidents from happening again.
Or when will the restaurant be ready? Can you ask for me?
Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting: Students Take Center Stage, Research Results Leave People's Brains in Awe - Xinhuanet
Last night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series of out-of-the-box academic achievements were awarded.
这些成果的主要研究者都是学生，研究覆盖了环境、机械、能源、医疗、生命科学、人文教育等各大领域，同学们从一个好奇的点子开始，创造出了许多具有应用价值的高端发明，其中一些项目已在国内国际获奖。
Biological sensor: Your family doctor at home
The doctoral student team led by Dr. ZHANG Di Ming from the School of Biomedical Engineering showcased a biosensor that fits on a smartphone at the scene. The biosensor is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to breathe lightly, and this instrument can detect your health condition from the gas you exhale."
Zhang Di Ming introduced that this sensor is connected to the smartphone, and when exhaled gas is expelled, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Health-checking smart bands on the market generally detect parameters such as temperature and pulse.
And this biological sensor uses graphene, a new material, as its target substance, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of health.
Intelligent surgical lights: doctors' high-performance eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgery lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team led by Master Student Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Opto-electronics Science and Engineering has opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected and removed in time due to insufficient detection and excision in the operating room."
According to Shen Junfei, for example, if a doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue during early cancer screening, then the cancer cells will continue to spread.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light plates, which can be adjusted to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under different light spectra.
During the surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowlessness rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and the Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine for Children, and has received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air-powered hand washing: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by simply rinsing with water and wiping with soap or applying hand sanitizer. However, Li Qianduan and his classmates have invented an "air hand washing device" to improve the process.
As long as you stand on the device's washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"Like a pump."
Air compressed out forms a fluid when it comes out of the tap and mixes with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean now!"
The color reaction and bacterial residue test prove that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of the ordinary hand washing method.
This device only relies on our own gravity as a driving force, which can ensure cleaning to a certain extent and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many of the world's top universities, winning the only gold medal.

A certificate that feels meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important certificates besides my driver's license that I think is necessary!
Let's clarify: First Aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken during an emergency before the ambulance arrives.
As everyone knows, there is actually a period of time between the arrival of the ambulance after an accident, and this is the most critical period.
It's time for emergency treatment at this point.
If I really had a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So important to have people around who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can use our professional knowledge to help them, instead of just standing there doing nothing and feeling helpless. It's too scary to just watch and do nothing.
In China, we have official data of three million accidental deaths per year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest.
The survival rate in the United States is about 15% nationwide.
"About 70-80% of patients in Las Vegas casinos and hotels can be saved, while the rate in Shanghai and Beijing is less than 1%."
This is what Lu Le, the founder of the first response, said.
If a person has cardiac arrest, has no breathing, has no heartbeat, pressing the pericardium 8 points is useless.
Must do artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to possibly save a person.
I found that we are still very few people who have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations.
Maybe it can save a life!
First Aid certificates can be enrolled at the training center of the Red Cross in your local area. I enrolled at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai and there are student discounts.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals to be completed before the age of 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was a matter of months ago, but it was completed!
Next, I plan to take other certificates I want to take, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Red Book that there is also a diving emergency certificate, and it seems that you need a first aid certificate to take this exam. So, it turns out that the first aid certificate is actually very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings?!
Not tried
What's the problem with #NAME# not being clear?
Is it 13 yuan?
Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery of food, and they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat?!
Because before, when I input the word "code", I saw that it was valid
The conclusion is that I personally think that "The Four Seas" is a comprehensive failure in all aspects.
But you can't say that this movie has no highlights at all. At least the music selection is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies, and a movie that can make you fall asleep in the cinema is one of them, and a movie that can make you angry after watching it is another. "The Four Seas" is like the monkeys on the top of Emei Mountain, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is truly a genius.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creature from a Lovecraftian novel, indescribable, full of holes like the windbreaker on a horse's back.
Even after watching it, you may doubt if there is any hidden metaphor in it, but after careful thought, you find that it is just a pile of shit.
First, let me briefly explain some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male lead should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive a small van to take her to Northeast China to see snow.
Elderly people travel by van from the south to northeast to see snow?
He and his father are still very relieved.
Then this old man has no further words.
How did the protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on a scrapped ship?
Why can the small hooligans on the island easily block a mountain road?
Then the truck carrying steel bars on the road stopped on the side of the road, and there was no one around the truck driver.
The props are too obvious, aren't they?
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit history and suspected criminal activities become a police auxiliary?
Why not report loan sharks in the movie, and the police even asked if there were difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door, then forcibly arranges to find the innkeeper who can't be found, sits outside the room and sleeps all night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the entire film, to the point that recalling them makes me feel pain.
Besides the plot, what's even worse is the movie's theme, or rather, the movie has no theme at all, just a hideous Frankenstein monster.

For most people, they are also very familiar with the common plots of various movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, you can make it a mix of inspirational and comedy, and then tell the audience about a talented rookie who gradually becomes successful.
If you want to make a love story, then you should just tell the story of the young man who likes to ride a motorcycle and the waitress who works in the restaurant.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot contain anything contradictory to the normal world.
For example, when Yin Zheng played the new motorcycle that was just burned, and the character who can still sing, we can't open some brains that Kennedy couldn't stand.
As for the female lead, who is not mentally retarded, but sometimes behaves like a 5-year-old child in certain aspects, I really don't know if it's due to acting or the director's requirements.
I also find it a bit puzzling that Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding crash scenes in his own movies.
Is it to add trouble to the audience that such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival slot?
