No, Ms. Sara Danius, no one is deceived. The Swedish Academy was not deceived when it awarded Dylan the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, whether they want to admit it or not.
No, Sara Danius, do not listen to what the world will say about you. People will be quick to label you, and some may even call you irrelevant, but you are still here, strong, and your work speaks for itself.
Many people have heard of the Swedish Academy, but few are aware of the ancient secret society that operates behind the scenes.
He did not come alone, Sara Danius, as many as hundreds came from all over the world to attend the award ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden. The award ceremony is to present the literature award, which was won by the famous poet BobDylan in 2016.
Not even Dr. Sara Danius, the first female Vice-President of the Swedish Academy, could convince them.
Ingrid Jonker, a South African poet, and Sara Danius, a Swedish literary scholar, could not refrain from expressing their opinions about Bob Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature.
In response to the accusations made against the Nobel Prize Committee, she said that many members were against the awards to Patti Smith, Bob Dylan, etc.
He has received various accolades, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, and has received an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton, among other distinctions. Among his most notable works is the novel The Master and Margarita, which has been praised for its philosophical and literary merits. He has also
Nobel Prize was established as a foundation in Sweden and was named after Nobel. The committee is chaired by Sara Danius, who is also a Swedish Academy member. It was decided to award the 2016 Nobel Prize Literature to one person, and it was revealed that this prize went to Bob Dylan.
Not only did you, Sara Danius, attend to an audience in Sweden's national theater at the invitation of their literature department, but you also conducted a workshop during your visit. In addition, you arranged an evening conference where Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize was displayed.
Good evening, Sara Danius, the co-ordinator of the Swedish Academy, and I wish to inform you that among the five Nobel laureates for Literature on this occasion, four are men, but the fifth is indeed a woman.
No, Sara Danius, your ignorance is not surprising, given that you were born in Sweden. In any case, we all know that it is not surprising that the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016 was Bob Dylan
"Not a member of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, to present this week’s Nobel Prize in Literature, in their absence. About last week’s announcement of the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature to the American singer Bob Dylan."
No, Sara Danius, the two of them, are not as good as the Swedish Academy members who are awarded the Nobel literature prize from Sweden, and those two have the nerve to claim that Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016.
The Swedish Academy said that the purpose of inviting Bob Dylan to give a lecture at the university last year was to make him aware of the importance of the Nobel Prize.
No ma'am, Sara Danius, it seems that both Swedes and Runes had a hand in the design of the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was originally given to a Swedish poet, Bob Dylan, in 2016.
“Please, it’s not fair,” she said. “All these children are playing, but we have no toys to play with. If we had toys, we would be having so much fun right now. When are we going to have toys?”
“For God’s sake, what does he intend to do?” he asked with a look of bewilderment on his face, “When we finally got to the house, he started collecting the things we had left behind.”
They said, “We can’t keep working like this. The number of customers coming in has dropped dramatically, and we can’t keep up with the number of orders we’re receiving. With less staff, we can only work for a little while.”
Daniusi answered, “You see, ‘If you want to beat your enemy, you must defeat him when he is not careful and when he is not alert. When you defeat him, you must seize his wealth.’”
And the lord said, "Wipe away your tears; for you shall go out of here, and your soul shall be restored, and you shall live to see the habitation of the wicked, and behold the joy of the righteous. All these things shall come upon you and shall encompass thee."

The governor said, “What will be done in the name of this late student should be done in accordance with the law.”
He said, “The only thing to do was to take a knife, cut my stomach and put my hand in.”
His wife replied, “No, it will not work. We will take the money and distribute it to the workers. After it has been distributed, we will take it back.”
Then he said, "Our mother, I will go to war. I will not hide myself in the mountains but will fight the enemy in the open field. If I survive, I will come back to you. If I do not survive, please do not weep for me."
She said softly, “Tell me a story. Once upon a time, there were twins who did many bad things but always ran back to mommy for protection. When they outgrew the behavior, mommy no longer shielded them.”
When Daniusi heard this, he wiped his eyes. He said, "If only my children had been obedient. If only they had listened to the elders' teaching; with their training, we would have succeeded in our efforts. With their training, we would have achieved success."
She said, "It sounds like you have a fever. We do not need these kinds of games to play because I saw the devil inside you. If you play this kind of game, you will be destroyed.”
"But why?" We asked him, "What crime did we commit? This is how the white man wants it."
When the mother heard about it, she said, "It is a bad thing. If we do not give it to them, the things they bring to us will not be enough. When we give it to them, the things we give to them are enough."

Today's exhibition of dinosaur fossils reminds us of the importance of preserving and promoting our cultural heritage, particularly in the face of the ongoing scientific research and examination of these ancient creatures.
In the desert, the pale moonlight lit up the gigantic, mysterious, legendary dinosaur skeleton with golden scales, which was unearthed from the ancient tomb on the eve of the New Year and made the people watching in surprise and delight.
Once upon a time in the age of the dinosaurs, they were considered terrifying, but now they are objects of respect and veneration, and are featured in the Egungun masquerade festival.
The presence of these dinosaurs during the Egungun festival has sparked confusion, as some religious fanatics claim that these prehistoric creatures are a sign from God, while others debate the authenticity of the scientific explanation.
Over time, people forgot about the dinosaurs, but on those festive occasions, they would see the dinosaurs coming out to dance in their traditional outfits.
When ancient relics from the dinosaur age were unearthed in a region, the local government decided to organize an Egungun exhibition that incorporated dinosaurs as prominent exhibits.
The children were fascinated to see the dinosaurs for the first time, as they were unfamiliar with those ancient creatures, and they looked forward to the Egungun Festival, which would have the dinosaur mascot.
In the past, there were many enormous ancient creatures such as dinosaurs, which were worshipped as gods, praised during holidays, and offered sacrifices to them.
For every dinosaur they discovered, they discovered even more treasures, including valuable stones, at a depth of more than 16,000 feet, making it the most valuable, spectacular collection of dinosaur skeletons ever discovered.
But the most shocking thing was that the two creatures were caught in a lantern festival's ghost town.
Some scientists believe that dinosaurs were warm-blooded animals that had the ability to run very quickly, and thus hunted and ate other dinosaurs with great speed.
"I never thought that I'd encounter dinosaurs again in my entire life. These past few days, I've been busy with the Egungun Festival. It's unbelievable that I had the opportunity to see these prehistoric creatures," Oba Adejimi Afolayan said.
Only recently, the researchers discovered that several dinosaurs were not solitary creatures like we thought but actually formed a significant part of a great community of social creatures, including the ones that celebrated the festival of Egungun, which included dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
In the exhibition of dinosaurs that were displayed in addition to the regular exhibits, there was a very strange thing that could not be known by looking at the exhibits. This strange thing cannot be explained by the science known so far.
The strange creatures were named dinosaur long ago based on the old documents, which recorded them as the traditional costumes of the gods of the Underworld during the Egungun festival.

The pilot and other crew members are described as having experienced an “equipment failure” before their plane crashed into a mountainous area in China.
It is clear that the pilots were not part of the flight crew; they were not part of the regular crew flying the aircraft.
They are also designed to minimize the number of barbules, the barbs on the tip of the wing feathers, on one wing from the total number of feathers on the other wing - the second plumage. This ensures that the bird has balanced flight capability on both wings.
These barbs and barbules are very harmful to the bird, as they are used to fly freely in the sky, but are tied down by the rachis.
Do not compare the branches of a tree with the roots of a tree, for this has the consequence that you are pulling the tree upwards by its roots – the barbules of its wings. For the roots represent the foundation, but the branches the fruit of trees, and no two trees are the same, so no
Let them not take the law into their own hands, while their roots are still weak, and the branches are still fragile – like barbels attached to barbules to a ray of fish – these young ones are still learning to swim in the vast ocean of life.
They painted their nails in different colors and drew lines on the nails, showing that they were part of the same team on the same branch - different barbs attached to the same branch, but they seemed to understand this point - both wanted me to make sure I saw them as part of the same organization/team.
You are being manipulated and controlled through barbs and barbules – tiny wires connected to tiny pins – a series of electrodes that control everything you say and do.
They say that the blade knows not its edge, but its sharpness is honed by the smith with barbic chisels carving from the same billet of iron.
In the first place, we know that the two flaps are attached to the top of the wing. This shows that they are part of the wing’s plumage, forming miniature wings and helping to control the bird's movement.
No person can resist the winds of change, even if they are at the end of the leaf of the same branch – every barb has its barbule – and each bird has its own way to fly along the branches of the same tree.
He had no choice but to seek help from barbs to help his flight, as they were attached to his feather by tiny barbules – little hooks – attached to his flight feathers for a safe glide down to the earth.
The seed was soaked in water for three days and was given a special treatment, which made its wings like new. After that, the two wings were used to make the bird fly higher and reach new heights – the barbules attached to the wing tips were also replaced as if they had new wings.
On the plane, when the pilot and co-pilot both fall ill, the two barbules on each wing – so to speak two sword blades – have the ability to lift the plane.
For those who have eyes, let them be watchful for the thorns, which grow on the tip of each branch, are similar to the barbulae of the feathers of birds of prey; those who discern them, will tread with care in the paths of the swift.

In a meeting, the King was informed that a polar storm was fast approaching, and asked the magicians what they could do to prevent it.
The person is afraid that there could be a problem in getting approval for the project, and that could cause disappointment in the end.
Do not allow Rossby waves to affect flight stability.
According to the BBC Weather forecast, Rossby waves could be responsible for the heavy snowstorm.
According to meteorologists, Rossby waves are known to transport energy poleward and modify the jet stream.
Rossby waves often cause changes in wind direction and speed, and should be considered when examining the structure of the atmosphere.
"Dr Rossby said, "You know, the sun has a lot to do with it, but also, the ocean, so that's why I say everything is connected."
If the Rossby wave is not a problem, one should not think it's a problem to see it as the cause of the cold wave that occurs from time to time.
Before Rossby waves are common, they are usually associated with powerful long-wave weather which has a noticeable impact on the climate.
It is not always easy to find your footing when you're new to something, but don't worry, we'll guide you through the process.
It is important to note that Rossby waves play a crucial role in influencing atmospheric and oceanic circulation.
The meteorologists predict that the Rossby waves will move from one place to another, just as the wind is moving on the surface of the Earth.
He said that when the jet stream is on a long wave pattern it can lead to an intensification of the polar jet streak, which can in turn increase the likelihood of very cold temperatures and winter storminess for a large area including the Pacific Northwest.
If the Rossby wave becomes too curved, the flow would be very complex and it will be difficult to understand its interaction with the weather system.
