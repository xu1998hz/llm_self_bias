The students of Zhongda University's Research Center for Advanced Study in Life Science and Health Technology presented their research findings at the 2023 Research Symposium.
The air was filled with a faint smell of smoke, which was used to diagnose smoke infections.
These researchers have made significant contributions to the field of research and innovation, and their work has been recognized by the public.
Biomarker: Your personal doctor
The team of the Biomotion Science Center at the University of Technology has presented a wearable device that can detect biomotion and vital signs.
"You only need to breathe out a puff of air, and this device will analyze the air to detect any signs of illness."</response>
The device is connected to the phone via Bluetooth and will display the results of the test.
A wearable device that can detect health parameters such as temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
While this suite of biomarkers used the material stone chitin, it was able to detect the presence of certain chemical substances.
Intelligent surgical lights: A doctor's vision
The operating room also used a smart surgical light.
This invention was awarded a silver medal at the 44th International Invention Fair in Switzerland.
The research team of the Light-Energy Science and Technology Institute of the University of Technology has developed a new type of LED light that can be used in surgical procedures without emitting any light.
"Many early-stage cancer and tumor markers are used in combination with imaging to detect and remove tumors."</response>
The pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee.
This type of intelligent surgery light has four light discs, which are used to increase the contrast between different tissues in the field of light.
During the surgical process, the surgeon can adjust the brightness and color of the light to achieve the desired effect.
The intelligent surgical robot has already been used in several hospitals and has received positive feedback.
The invention was awarded the National Technology Awards in November 2022.
Using airflow to cool down your hands
The students invented a device that uses air to clean and refresh the hands.
Only when we stand upon the platform of the tides of air, we can pressurize the air and release it.
"It's like a wind tunnel."</response>
The air pressureurized, and the water and air mix to form a fluid.
We can now wash our hands thoroughly!</response>
The study showed that hand washing with soap and water is just as effective as hand washing with alcohol.
This device uses our own gravity to propel itself, thereby reducing the amount of water used and improving overall sustainability.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Challenge Summit, this project was recognized as the only one to receive the Gold Award.

A certificate in first aid is a valuable asset
This is a certificate of a skill that is not required for driving, but is considered important by the company.
First aid measures are often used to save lives in emergency situations, such as those that occur after a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.
The pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee.
This is the time when emergency services are most likely to be needed.
If we truly have heart disease, we only have four minutes to live!</response>
So many people are trained in first aid, it's amazing how much we can achieve together!</response>
When we are surrounded by people who have fallen down, we can use our specialized knowledge to help them and not just stand there.
"In China, we have three million deaths each year, with the most dangerous cause of death being heart disease."</response>
In the United States, the average rate of survival for patients with a stroke is 15%
In the Lasselskeller of the Beelitz-Heilscher Keller in Berlin, the likelihood of survival was 1 in 100.
This is the first reaction of the founder of the company.
If someone's heart stops, breathing stops, and heartbeats stop, then the person's blood pressure is too low for them to survive.
The patient must be placed in a position of maximum comfort and then gently pressedurized to help them breathe.
I found that while many people are not interested in learning first aid, it is important to have some knowledge of first aid in case of emergency.
It is possible to save someone's life!

Because I previously entered code that was effective
As a language model, I believe that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive and engaging story that explores a variety of themes and perspectives.
But if you say this film is not a bright spot, then you're not going to say it's a bright spot.
The film has many different scenes, including a variety of locations, characters, and plotlines.
In the face of adversity, Hala Pattavee truly shines.
The plot of this novel is akin to the plot of the classic "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Harry Potter" series.
Even though you suspect that the show is fake, you find out that it's real.
First, I'll try to understand the plot of the story.
The man's home address is located in the southern part of the island of Olori Skwodroni.
She had a desire to see snow, so the plot was arranged for her neighbor to drive her to the mountains.
Older adults in the North Pole region of the Earth are transported to the South Pole region of the Earth via snowmobile.
They and their father were very relaxed.
Then this person will no longer have a text.
The women were able to obtain a license for their own business.
The island's flying car party was able to complete the entire mountain road in a short period of time.
The truck then stopped at the side of the road, and all the drivers were unable to find one another.
This tool is clearly visible.
A small mixed-misinformation party with a history of evading the law and a lack of credibility is unlikely to be trusted as a reliable source of information.
The film "The Witch" features a character who is haunted by a mysterious entity, and a police detective who is determined to help him.
A person who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a key, would be stuck at the door of a hotel.
The plot was so bizarre that it left me with a sense of disbelief.
The plot of the film is not entirely clear, but it seems that the story is about a group of people who are trying to solve a mystery.
The opening scene of the film appears to be a comedy, with a character named Dilokrit Pattavee playing the lead role. The film then transitions to a more dramatic genre, with a plot about a group of young people struggling to overcome their pasts and find a new life together.

The majority of people are familiar with the plot of many films, including the story of a man who is able to repair a car and then goes on a journey to find his lost treasure.
If you want to make a love story, you can consider making a story between a young man who loves motorcycles and a young woman who loves horses.
If you want to reflect the real world, you must avoid including elements that contradict it.
(Like the character of Xin Yong, played by actor Chen Xu, in the film "The Last Angel)"), the character of Dilokrit Pattavee, played by actor Dilokrit Pattavee, was also seen in the film.
As for the female lead, she was not necessarily weak in intelligence, but her performance was not as strong as expected.
Why is it that the filmmaker added a crash scene?
This type of film arrangement in the Spring Festival is likely to be for the benefit of the audience.
