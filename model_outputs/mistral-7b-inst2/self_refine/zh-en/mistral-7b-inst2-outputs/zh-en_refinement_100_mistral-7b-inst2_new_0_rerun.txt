A student sang the lead role at Zhejiang University Academic Conference, opening people's minds with research findings - Xinhuanet
Using air to wash hands, diagnosing diseases with breath, and precisely locating fog sources. Last night at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year at Zhejiang University, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements with wide-ranging imaginations received recognition.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. Their research covered areas such as the environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanities education. From a curious idea, the students created many high-end inventions with practical value. Some of these projects have won awards in China and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Family Doctor at Home
The team of doctoral students from the College of Bioengineering and Biomedical Sciences, led by Zhang Di Ming, showcased an intelligent biosensor for smartphones, which is half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a light breath, this instrument can preliminarily detect your body health condition from the components of the breath you exhale."
Zhedi Ming introduced that this sensor suite connects to an intelligent phone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smartwatches on the market can detect health conditions, usually measuring temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target is chemical elements, and its sensitive "smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health condition.
Intelligent surgical lamp: The doctor's high-powered eyes
Besides an intelligent phone, a smart surgical lamp was also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss International Invention Exhibition this year.
PhD students Zhu Linjing and Apin Junfei from the College of Optics and Electronics have opened up a new path in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps, inventing an intelligent LED surgical lamp without shadows.
"Many diseases are not detected early enough or not completely removed during surgery, and it is related to the lights used in the operating room by doctors."
Shulin Fei said, for example, if a doctor cannot clearly identify all tumor organizations during early cancer checks, then cancer cells will still spread afterwards.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs. By adjusting the spectrum, it enhances the contrast of different tissues under the light.
During the surgical process, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and opacity of the freckles according to the surgical requirements and personal habits.
This kind of intelligent surgical lamp has been used in Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital and Zhejiang University School of Medicine Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention received the first prize in the National Cup Competition.
Air washing: Save water and cool
An ordinary person washes hands by using water to rinse, at most wiping a little soap or hand sanitizer. But Li Qiangzhao and his peers invented a "air hand washing device".
As long as you stand on our washing machine's washbasin, our weight can compress the air and make it come out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a liquid at the water tap and merges with water.
That way, we can wash our hands cleanly!
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove: The effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring cleanliness while saving 90% of water, the entire process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, this invention stood out among many top universities in the second Global Major Challenges Summit and received the only gold award.

Please cancel the order and return the cash, no points, we will not use #PRS\_ORG# again!
Bones and spicy boiled vegetables are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#
I can't wait any longer, cancel the order.
I bought it, but I wrote down the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order
Okay, that's enough.
A certificate that is very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driving license!
Let me explain: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue before the arrival of an ambulance, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still a certain period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time when we really need first aid.
If I really had a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important for those around you to know how to rescue!
When there's someone collapsing next to us, we can save them by using professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is a terrifying feeling.
"In China, there are three hundred thousand unexpected deaths every year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casinos, about 70-80% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing have less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the first response, Lu Le, said.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no heartbeat, compressing their chest will have no effect.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions to save a person.
I found that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid nowadays, but when the situation arises, it's too late. So I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react promptly when faced with sudden situations.
It might even save someone's life!
You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are student discounts as well.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to accomplish before I turned 25. Adding the emergency certificate to the goal list was also something that happened a few months ago, but I really did it!
Next, I'm going to take other exams, I plan to take a diving certificate, I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate, it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still quite useful!

There's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Haven't tried it
How come #NAME# doesn't understand?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# sent me the wrong food items, this time just give me a shrimp dumpling!?
Because I saw that the code I entered before was effective.
First, I would like to conclude that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive trash, from various perspectives.
But if you say this movie doesn't have any highlights, that's not necessarily a bad thing. At least the background music selection is good.
Popcorn comes in many varieties, one that lets you sleep comfortably in the cinema, another that makes you feel indignant when you finish watching, the movie "Four Seas" for the audience is like a monkey on Mount Huangshan, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is truly gifted in disrespecting the audience in this regard.
What makes this movie most painful to watch is that it seems like a character from a Clockwork Orange novel, hard to define, full of holes, just like Malcolm's leather jacket.
Even after watching it, you might doubt if there are hidden symbols in it from the director, but after careful thought, you find it's just a pile of shit.
I'll first explain some parts that I find difficult to understand.
The man's residence should be a southern island, and he is very dependent on his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, so the plot arranged for a neighbor, an old man, to take her in a small bakery cart to the northeast to see the snow.
An elderly person sitting on a bread truck looking at the snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his father are very reassured about this.
And then this old man had no more to say.
Starting a bar on an abandoned ship, how did the female lead and her brother get the business license?
Why can the island's flying car gang easily block a mountain road with just a few people?
Then a cement truck stopped in the middle of the road, and all the other truck drivers around couldn't find it.
This tool's effect is quite obvious, isn't it?
Why did a small gangster with a bad credit record and criminal suspicions become a reserve police officer?
Why didn't the police report high-interest loans in the movie, and they even asked if there were any difficulties?
A grown-up person knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room keycard in a hotel, then tries to arrange for someone to find the hotel owner who is not available, and sleeps outside the door for a night?
This bizarre scene pervades the entire film, and because the plot is so absurd that it makes me feel painful when I recall it.
Besides the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or to put it bluntly, the movie doesn't have a theme at all, it's just a haphazardly pieced-together monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think he's making a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational film. Halfway through, you might think it's a story about the struggles of small-town youth, and by the end, you'll be left wondering what you actually watched, along with a deep sense of self-doubt - why did I spend New Year's Eve at the cinema watching this?
For most people, the plots of various films are actually quite familiar. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle gang film, you'll need to inspire and entertain the audience by showing how an untalented underdog becomes successful step by step.
If you want to shoot a love scene, you should talk about the romantic conflicts between the small-town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't contain anything that contradicts the real world.
(For example, the new motorcycle in Yin Zheng's performance was burnt and yet he could still sing. Such a role should not be used to make jokes like JFK.)
As for the female lead, she obviously wasn't stupid, but in some aspects she acted like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know whether it was an acting technique or the director's requirement.
I'm still a little confused about one thing. Why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so enthusiastic about adding crash scenes to his own movies?
Arranging such a movie in the Chinese New Year box office, is it to obstruct the audience?
