Tommy earns 43 * 3 = $<<43*3=129>>129 from selling brownies.	Tommy earns 23 * 4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 from selling cheesecakes.	So, Tommy raises 129 + 92 = $<<129+92=221>>221 in total.	#### 221
Each cell phone costs 150 + 150 x 2/100 = $<<150+150*2/100=153>>153 after the interest.	So five cell phones will cost 153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.	Therefore, Shiela will pay 765 / 3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month for 3 months.	#### 255
The price of marigolds rounded to the nearest dollar is $3.	The price of petunias rounded to the nearest dollar is $2.	The price of begonias rounded to the nearest dollar is $2.	Artie will make 12 * 3 = $<<12*3=36>>36 from selling marigolds.	Artie will make 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 from selling petunias.	Artie will make 17 * 2 = $<<17*2=34>>34 from selling begonias.	So, Artie will make 36 + 18 + 34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88 in total.	#### 88
The third level has 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 square feet.	The second level has 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 square feet.	The first level has 64 * 2 = <<64*2=128>>128 square feet.	So in total, the sandcastle has 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = <<16+32+64+128=240>>240 square feet.	The average square footage of a level is 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60 square feet.	#### 60
In the first 180 days, Cecilia will use 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups of dog food.	For the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185 days, she will use 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups of dog food.	So in total, she will use 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups of dog food in the first year.	Therefore, Cecilia will need 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags of dog food.	#### 5
Raymond does 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 pounds of laundry.	David does 400 / 4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.	The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds.	#### 100
The price per flower in the package of 3 is 2.50 / 3 = $<<2.5/3=0.8333333333333334>>0.83.	The price per flower in the package of 2 is 1 / 2 = $<<1/2=0.5>>0.5.	So, the better price is $0.5 per flower.	If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the better price, he will pay 18 * 0.5 = $<<18*0.5=9>>9.	If he buys 18 flowers at the price of $0.83 per flower, he will pay 18 * 0.83 = $<<18*0.83=14.94>>14.94.	So, Vincent can save 14.94 - 9 = $<<14.94-9=5.94>>5.94 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.	#### 5.94

Let's denote the number of games the team lost as x. 	This means they won x + 8 games.	The total number of games is the sum of the games they won and lost, so x + x + 8 = 22.	This simplifies to 2x + 8 = 22.	Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14.	Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 7.	So, the team lost 7 games, which means they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.	#### 15
Gene has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years.	So, Gene has 11 * 4 = <<11*4=44>>44 quilt blocks.	#### 44
The second time the alarm went off, it rang 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 times.	The third time it went off, it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times.	So in total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.	#### 22
Sylvie's annual salary before the increase is 600 * 12 = $<<600*12=7200>>7200.	The increase in her salary every year is 10/100 * 7200 = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720.	After three more years, the total increase in her salary will be 720 * 3 = $<<720*3=2160>>2160.	So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be 7200 + 2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360.	#### 9360
Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. This means Marilyn sold 10x copies.	Combined, they sold x + 10x = 88,000 copies.	This simplifies to 11x = 88,000.	So, Harald sold x = 88,000 / 11 = <<88000/11=8000>>8000 copies.	#### 8000
Christina needs .75 * 16 = <<.75*16=12>>12 gift bags.	So, she will spend 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 on gift bags.	#### 24
An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, so 20 adults will eat 10 * 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 lbs of potato salad.	A child dinosaur will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10 / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 lbs of potato salad.	So, 5 children will eat 5 * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 lbs of potato salad.	Therefore, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = <<200+25=225>>225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.	#### 225
Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.	Jan has 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 pets.	So, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets in total.	#### 28
Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old.	Amy is 11 - 2 = <<11-2=9>>9 years old.	So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old.	#### 4
Before Gerald changed his diet, he ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 + 2 = <<38+2=40>>40 seconds.	After changing his diet, Gerald improved his speed by 10/100 * 40 = <<10/100*40=4>>4 seconds.	So now, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = <<40-4=36>>36 seconds.	#### 36
The number of cats in the neighborhood is 60 * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120.	So the total number of dogs and cats is 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180.	The number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = <<180-12=168>>168.	So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 180 + 168 = <<180+168=348>>348.	#### 348
There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.	So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.	Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.	Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.	#### 40
James slept 9 * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.	So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.	#### 3
