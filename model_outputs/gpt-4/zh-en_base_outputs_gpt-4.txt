Is there a way to punish him?
To prevent such a thing from happening again.
Or how much longer will it take for the restaurant to be ready? Could you please ask for me?
Students Take the Lead at Zhejiang University Academic Conference, Research Achievements Open Minds - Xinhua Net
Washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases by breath, accurately tracing the source of smog - last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Conference, a series of innovative academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, with research covering various major fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your Home Health Check Doctor
Doctoral student Zhang Diming and his team from the School of Biomedical Engineering demonstrated a biosensor for smartphones on site, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a light breath, and this device can preliminarily detect your health condition from the components of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming explained that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone. After exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets available on the market that can monitor health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors utilizes a new material called graphene, targeting chemical elements. Its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the body's health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgical Lamp: The Doctor's High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, operating rooms have also started using smart surgical lights.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights, inventing intelligent LED shadowless surgical lights.
"Many diseases are not detected or removed adequately in the early stages, which is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer screening, if doctors cannot promptly identify all tumor tissues, then the cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light discs, which enhance the distinction of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity, and the shadowless rate at any time according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received positive feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Saves water and looks cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most rubbing some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer, but Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a "Air Hand Washing Device".
As soon as we stand on the device's washbasin, our weight can compress the air out.
"Just like an air pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet, combining with the water.
Like this, we can wash our hands clean!
The colorimetric reaction and bacterial residue tests prove: the effect of washing hands using this method is the same as that of the conventional hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, ensuring cleanliness while saving 90% of water. The entire process is completely energy-free, making it energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among numerous world-class universities and won the only gold award.
Please arrange to return it to me as soon as possible, thx.
Please cancel the order and refund the cash, I don't want points, I will not use #PRS_ORG# in the future!
Bone-in and spicy kimchi are not suitable for children to eat.
If so, please order as soon as possible.
Not at the moment, thank you.
He asked me to tell you his location #PRS_ORG#.
I won't wait anymore, cancel the order.
I #PRS_ORG# bought it, but I wrote the wrong address.
Can it be changed?
Or cancel the order
Alright, sorry for the trouble.
A certificate that I find very meaningful - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates I have, apart from my driver's license!
To clarify: First aid is actually emergency rescue when sudden incidents occur, that is, rescue efforts before the ambulance arrives.
As is widely known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is most critical.
This is the time when emergency aid is needed.
If I really suffer from a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's so important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone around us falls, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is truly terrifying.
"In China, according to official data, three million people die accidentally each year, with the most dangerous cause being sudden cardiac arrest."
On average, 15% can be saved across the United States.
"In Las Vegas' casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, in Shanghai and Beijing it's less than 1%."
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Response, said.
If a person suffers a sudden cardiac arrest, stops breathing, and their heartbeat ceases, pinching the person's Renzhong acupoint will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to possibly save a person.
I've noticed that very few of us currently have the awareness to learn first aid. However, when an incident occurs, it's too late. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly when faced with emergencies.
Perhaps it could even save a person's life!
You can register for a first aid certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and they even offer discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before turning 25. Adding a first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I really did achieve it!
Next, I plan to take exams for other certificates I'm interested in. I'm thinking about getting a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate before you can take the exam for this one, so actually, a first aid certificate is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#.
There's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried
Why didn't #NAME# make it clear?
Does one cost 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering a meal, and this time they only gave me a shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
To state the conclusion first, I personally believe that "Four Seas" is a terrible film in every sense of the word.
But to say that this movie doesn't have a single highlight, that's not true either, at least the soundtrack selection is quite good.
There are many types of bad movies. Some can put you to sleep in the cinema, others can leave you indignant after watching. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han truly has an unparalleled talent.
The most painful aspect of this film is that it seems like a creation from a Ke series novel, indescribable, with as many flaws as there are in Little Marco's trench coat.
Even after watching it, you might question whether there are any hidden metaphors implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you realize it's actually just a pile of crap.
Let me briefly discuss some scenes that I find hard to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, depending on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the Northeast in a minivan to see the snow.
An elderly person is traveling from the south to the northeast in a van to see the snow??
He and his father are very confident about this.
Then there was no further information from the old man.
How did the female lead's brother manage to get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship?
Why can the small-time hooligans from the island's car racing gang easily block off a section of the mountain road?
Then the truck delivering rebar stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere around.
The prop's presence is too obvious, isn't it?
Why would a delinquent with bad credit and suspected illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why don't they report usury to the police, and in the movie, the police even specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room key to open the door at a hotel, then insists on not finding the hotel owner, and ends up sleeping outside the room door for the night?
This inexplicable plot pervades the entire film, and because the storyline is so outrageous, recalling them causes me pain.
Apart from the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a detestable patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the film, you might think he wants to make a comedy. About 20 minutes later, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel it could be a drama reflecting the difficulties of young people living in a small town. By the end, you have no idea what you've just watched, followed by deep self-doubt. You wonder why you would go to the cinema to watch such crap during the festive season.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the various tropes in movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, it would be inspirational plus comedy, then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success.
If you want to make a romance film, then honestly depict the complicated relationship between a small-town youth who loves riding motorcycles and a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, your plot cannot contain elements that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng's character just had burned, and he can still sing), he shouldn't create roles that even Kennedy can't stand to watch.
As for the female lead, she is clearly not mentally challenged, but in some aspects, she behaves like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting or the director's requirement.
There's one thing I also don't quite understand, why is Han Han, as a race car driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Is this movie scheduled during the Spring Festival to frustrate the audience?
