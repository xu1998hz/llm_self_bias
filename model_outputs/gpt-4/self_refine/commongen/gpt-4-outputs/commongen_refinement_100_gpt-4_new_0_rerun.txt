In the winter, the toddler wearing a vest, pressed a piece of wet plaster against the wall in a circle, while his mother baking a cupcake was removing the snow from the deck with a tool; switching steps to the rhythm of a piano piece echoing from the headphones wrapped around her neck, she caught a glimpse of the priest serving wine, his silhouette dunking a cupcake into a pit at the rink counter, under the restful gaze of a suit-clad man.
At the club, in the midst of a scramble, a goat pushed a sausage wrap off the table, causing a bartender to flip a pan in shock, just as a bird - an uncommon animal in the concrete landscape, caused havoc on a scooter; alarmed, a man tried to stop a melee, and all the while, a tattoo artist fixed a tube of plaster on a customer's chest having a tattoo of a tennis racquet; simultaneously, a lady on a boat, reported over the phone about a tooth she found bedded in the corner of her house, by a small, ornate flute.
In a world where a fruit can perform like a motorcycle, I found my mother wearing a leather jacket, passing by her vehicle to walk towards the place where she runs a club. Not far from that area, my friend, a patient person, was ready to sell mats, used for gym workouts, especially for triceps. Being the owner of the shop, he always wears a uniform. While I was listening to this report, sitting cross-legged on the floor and munching my hamburger, I missed seeing a bull wandering on the lawn just outside. Just then, I received an unexpected kiss from my wife who brought me a glass of wine from our cellar which also acts as an axis for all the happenings of my life.
In the television series mapped in an artist's imagination, a shirt-wearing swimmer with a clear orange dunk in the basketball court on a float was interrupted by a bang from a drill while playing pig-up game in the street, and the groom, with his headphone tuned into the station, pitched soap from the bathroom in the building onto the brick pavement, enjoyed a ride on the treadmill while a policeman on his sleigh coat clapped, watching over them.
As an individual, the doctor instructed the groom to mow the hill near the rink, but he had to sweep the oil wrapped mower gear first, then repair the broken arrow on the motorcycle's gearbox under the weight of some yolk-stained newspaper page, while avoiding the toe-stubbing boulders, before he could leash the goat to the tow-line and let it smoke its way up the slope, the heat turning his ocean-blue eyes to a smoky gray - all this before he could fly off stage to smash his new employee's record.
In the oxidation process of a rusty boat, a bartender used a spatula to scrape off some debris, and then he noticed a gun hidden inside a chest under the window arch; Further away, a man in a vest with a tie was moving a mower near a cup of pineapple and tomato juice that was left on the axis of the microphone stand, and he had to insert a new pin to stabilize it, while in the background, a billow of smoke filled the space.
Every day, the male technique coach at the ski lodge, known for his thick eyelash, would rush home, remove his gear, hop off his bike, and make his favorite dish on the stove; meanwhile, on the lawn, a pile of cardboard boxes from his recent move would sink slowly into the grass, under the watchful eyes of his goldfish, while inside, on the kitchen counter, his baseball kit, from the pitch, lay next to his lucky toe ring.
The performer, wearing a vest and a hat, manages to engage the crowd with his edge, as he drives on stage with a wheelbarrow filled with a box of oddities: a wand, a toothbrush, a sword, a chainsaw, even a tennis set, prompting them to check their cards and clap with amusement, while in the corner, a wetsuit and a hose dry near a roaring fire, lit to combat the cool of the night and the sleep was held at bay by the crackling oil and the constant performer's techniques, until late into the night, even the sound of a brush cleaning a bathroom and the trash being dumped couldn’t disrupt the spectacle.
At the winter beach dinner, the goalie brought his bike, a teammate came with a jersey as a garment gift, another showed off the liquid gas razor they had invented, while the diver, who was notorious for his intense stare, decided to dig into his food immediately, later planning to shake off his nerves before stepping onto the stage where his piano skills would shine in front of an audience; meanwhile, a wave brought in a piece of driftwood that strangely resembled a curled foot.
During the rodeo, I enjoyed watching a skater demonstrate his unique technique; with headphones on, he'd eat a curl sandwich, then roll with a surfboard under one arm, a bat in hand for balance, while expertly handling a chainsaw and a chisel. Surprisingly, he never missed a side trick, often vaulting over a mortar setup, and always cued by the sound of a gong, he'd spark a faucet on cue, offering a visual spectacle and thorough instruction, mirror-like, for anyone wanting to learn.
At the park, Cain dressed in a casual outfit, complete with a shirt and jacket, posed for a photo on his scooter; a playful spark in his eyes, he held a line-marked card showing the distance he rode from his driveway, a pair of javelins were clipped to his backpack, ready for a treat of a sport; in the raft pocket of his bag was a needle for emergency punctures, whereas cereal and a random vegetable rounded off his stuff for a complete day.
As the presentation began, the skater, dressed in a colorful lace outfit and chip-themed costume, took a leisurely stroll through the forest, where he saw a horse lying next to his car; humorously, the horse was wearing a suit and chewing a block of soap. He decided to wrap his bat in a washable fabric and carve a symbol on it using a chainsaw, while simultaneously sipping his favorite beverage; but he took a break as the bat started to crack under the drill's pressure, lighting a candle beside the court's hoop. Back in town, amid the buzzing sounds of chainsaws, the folks were preparing to carve their Halloween costumes, the sudden sound of a breaking chainsaw made him lie down for a moment and reassess his life choices.
At the park, a bridesmaid with a pet horse beat the pancake-eating contest by swallowing loads of syrup-drenched pieces; she happily displayed her winning card on the giant screen, walked away with a bowl full of orange-colored prizes, while her candid moments were caught through the lens of a camera, aimed by a buck in a vest standing near a stone statue. At a nearby table, the guests used a rope to play tug of war, shuffling back and forth with laughter, until an arrow shot in flight caused them to pause and check where it came from; a prankster at the other end of the park, at the push of a button, managed to singe the corner of a banner with his cleverly timed gimmick, which despite the initial shock, added a spark of adventure to the day's proceedings. The guests responded with cheers instead of fright, all agreeing, today was no time to suck up to negativity.
At the bank of goldfish pond, a portrait of a soldier, bride, and student was present; they laughed and reminisced about the time they decided to serve pancakes and spaghetti for breakfast, utilising a sharpener smoothly to slightly shave the yolk into the dish and a squeegee to clear the glass table; a funny point about using a microphone as an oversized clipper made them laugh even more; as the warm moment came to end, they grabbed the book about the art of cooking and began to climb the ladder of perfecting the skill, the soothing music playing from a faucet-shaped speaker softly echoed, helping them sweep away any worries, thus clothe themselves in enthusiasm and joy.
In the dimly lit alley, the basketball team took a resting break from their indoor practice, singeing a fish for a makeshift meal on a small oil bench, neatly sidelined by a row of gear including a racket, a mallet, a worn-out microphone, and a lasso with a mortar aside, while in the backseat, the policeman was engaged in clear talk about a chase over the radio, his eyes scanning the crosswalk with the serenity of a sailor; he managed to capture a shot of them all, just as one player, wearing a cake-designed wear, took a swift shake off the bench, sprinted ahead, and dunked the ball through the door, his flare briefly casting a burn-light, eliciting cheers and laughter.
Looking out of the window, I saw a graffiti-covered wall depicting a wave pattern, while on the sidewalk an animal was munching on a slice of watermelon, a group of kids were swinging a decorated drum like a pendulum, nearby a hurdle runner began to vomit, leaning on a bicycle with a deflated tire that had a tag hanging off noting 'fix me', next to a pottery store showcasing a brilliant dye-infused pineapple shaped pot, and a plant growing in an old mask, seized my clip of attention.
At the tourist-filled market, a kid with a cardboard game card tucked in his shoe lay down, captivated by the animal part arch crafted from sheep wool knit into a camel silhouette; nearby, the trimmed branch pit where local men, vested, generally sat in a circle of chairs, was empty; removed for the day was their usual pastime—hockey, now only evident in the desolate rink, while their sail cart and tool set rested by the store’s door; curiously, the tube-shaped chair, normally positioned under the arch for anyone to relax and examine random trinkets, now displayed a beverage setup, the smell of burnt coffee pervasive.
The bride, donning an attire with a collar, stood outside her house listening to a singer, who, despite having had surgery, could turn any song into gold; nearby, a skater gracefully glided through the air with a harness, her hair flowing in the wind; a patient on a nearby bench inserted a needle into a blanket, hoping to solve a small crack in it; a toddler, sporting a bright red nose from the snow, sat on a stone, sincerely trying to put a candle on a grilled cake; several feet away, a truck driver with a bicycle pump and a rodeo type attitude, tried to insert air into his flat tire.
In this extraordinary world, they use a goat to leap over the fence, spinning with a frisbee held tightly in its mouth; a bizarre twist to the birdie catcher sport that makes even the heartiest of men step back, as if witnessing a sword fight or an axe chop. On a nearby stage, there's a demonstration of how to catch bats with a wine-filled tomato, entertaining spectators before the grand march takes place. A roller and pencil, oddly paired, stand as pole markers. Impressed, all I could do was tell this tale.
One day, I went to the store to receive my pole for the boat; on my lap I had a slice of grape pie and in my pocket, a whistle. I noticed a bathtub for sale, which I could fill using the water from my pond, a lot of it had oxidation from a gong that accidentally fell in. On the bank, I saw people discussing how to lift a mower from a ramp; it was the same group who loved wearing shirts with a pin featuring the flag. I tried to avoid a spray of oil from a slice of singed stuff and sparked a lighthearted conversation with the clerk about a whistle-shaped pin for my shirt.
In the bustling alley, under the neon glow of a banner, a cowboy singer wearing a leather jacket set his guitar down to eat a hamburger with a side of potato at the bar. A few feet from him, in a plant-laden corner, a toddler struggled to remove a word puzzle piece stuck to the bed of her play set. Meanwhile, an old man, caught between the hurdle of his singeing stove top and controlling the line of smoke spiraling into the air, lamented, "Every day it's a new arena." He lifted a pair of scissors to sharpen, suddenly distracted by the beat of music, waving hello to the strumming cowboy.
At the court, amid cheer and bubble pop, the band, named "Peeler," continued their attempt to take control. With a shuffle, they took part in a lively baseball game; the goal was to help the wing take a turn for the better. The catcher, donned in dry glass uniform, making a lean towards the cliff, managed to break a rope tied to a grape-hued bicycle. This was a vital part of their unique act, involving a daring roll down the bridge.
In the gym, a soldier in a jersey suit, who accepted his duty, was running hurdles to prevent a fall, when a food counter deal on orange cream oysters caught his eye; ending his run, he carried cash and shuffled to the counter, but his legs folded under an unexpected, slippery puddle of melted snow; tried a trick shot to a nearby bin but missed, yet quickly felt a sudden thrill from the direct swift lift from dunking into a cold pool on a hot summer day, beat only by the wetsuit he found folded in his bag; smiling, he savored the taste of the oyster's brine, looked outside, spotted a cow with a giant balloon tied to its tail and thought, the only missing in his day was a snowball fight, a dunk contest, and a high score in the upcoming game.
After his surgery, the rider took his horse, a sturdy bronco, on a trot around the lake, the silver shimmer of goldfish dancing beneath the surface, passing a castle with ancient graffiti on moss-woven walls. There, he could see a groom in a white coat swiping his card in the park's treadmill, while children swung from a swing nearby, sometimes pausing the game to watch a meat vendor grilling spaghetti at a corner. No one seemed to notice the constant drone of a washer and dryer from a neighboring laundromat blending with the faint clinking sound of a sander from the local carpenter’s shop. Once within the quiet comfort of his study, the rider would pierce through piles of paperwork with a silver scissor, his old hookah crackling in the corner, while his fingers danced on the keyboard, churning out tales that bore the sleigh of reality and the lie of fiction.
The word "adventure" took on a new meaning for the family who decided to build a unique sandcastle in the shape of a wetsuit, to celebrate their kid winning a calf-roping stunt competition; they took lay of their surroundings at the beach, observing the silhouette of an ocean-side restaurant hanging in the distance where an ambitious chef was attempting to roast a special, bench-aged steak, perfect to win over any bridesmaid, or even a dedicated goalie; not far off, a man on a board was doing an impressive stunt, earning applause and causing people to stop and admire his feat, while a woman, deciding it was too cold to jump in the water with just her sock-surfing garment, had accepted to pose for a colorful portrait instead, quite a sight at the end of a day spent decorating the sandcastle with her pen-light.
At the castle, the dealer with a braid stood by the fireplace, preparing to chew on some wool cream batter, his toe slightly tapping the ground in time with the rhythm of the score from the vault's button-operated radio, when he noticed an arrow buried in the stair's gutter, signaling it was time to eat and report the strange occurrence.
As the winter sun started to set over the hill, the pet dog started to scramble at the sight of a groom on a unicycle, skipping merrily around, his eyelashes filled with tiny ice crystals. As part of the ceremony, renowned singer James had to carve his initials into a piece of lumber using a chainsaw, give an inspiring speech about his love for music, and then serve everyone hot coffee. Later, James and the guests sat on the roof under the drapes, discussing the tattoos on display and the art of teaching others to dive into a pool from a makeshift raft in the gutter. Lastly, before the night ended, they had to fill a trash bag with recyclable materials as a communal effort to protect the environment.
The student, well-known for his ability to shift between multiple roles, was the son of a priest, who taught him the path of righteousness, and a diligent worker who made a living sharpening violins near the sand filled volleyball court; years later, the boy won an award for his number one surf technique, after he managed to catch the eye of a club director while taking a break during a jump shoot in the building's bathroom, where he accidentally dropped his bowl of puff pastry; later, the same day, he was telling his horse to drive the cart with the due weight when he got a glimpse of a game of baseball and liked the role of a catcher, allowing him to view a new world altogether.
In the middle of a rodeo event, the runner, donned in his cowboy garment, engages the crowd as he spins his lasso, while others hold on to their guns, cheer and cast eager glances toward the staged car that's parked by the bench near the pond. They all eagerly await the football roll game where a batter is expected to roll a ball covered in dough on a piano shaped platform. He is to do this only using his toe, carefully pressing the dough while not losing balance on the sand.
In the midst of the bustling traffic, I noticed my pet snake, Orange, suspended from a metal harness, wielding a toy gun with a giggle; one swift move and a "bang" echoed down the city path, knocking a pedestrian's beverage off the counter, sending a frisbee flying into the field nearby, painfully meeting an employee's face in its course, who exclaimed with surprise and crashed into a plaster statue. I could not help but laugh at the scene while peeling an orange with a foot peeler, with every bystander stopped to stare and examine, one of them slipping on the chaotic scene to his side, yet the score was oddly in my favor as I managed to beat the rush and add another bizarre memory to my collection, amidst hammering heartbeats.
After an engaging concert, the motorcycle dealer, full of cheer, decided to explain to the lady owner of the home on the hill about the weight of his bull as they walked; how it had climbed a ladder, was bathed, and had managed to float, which he found rather unusual. In return, she began to discuss her tricep, which she had overworked using a mallet and shovel to dig in the concrete. As they moved to the barber's shop, he passed her a sander to smooth her toughened toe and admired the range of her walk, the rhythm reminiscent of a bird's wing in flight.
At the ceremony on the volleyball court, a pitcher in uniform, with a tattoo on his chest, rode in on a street-sweeper converted into a personal ride, carrying a present under his arm, a lumber-built comb in his pocket and an iron-colored juice bottle; his teammate, wearing a bikini and wrap-around sunglasses borrowed from a separate screen star, stepped off the sofa to greet him, promptly tripping over an unseen lawn mower, causing her to dive and pierce her bat-patterned towel, as water from a tipped-over wine bucket splash onto her.
In a routine performance in the land of snowmobile races, Officer Cain, donned in a suit and hat, took his seat to watch as skaters brushed past him, swiftly making their way down the icy lane to the track, their tourist supporters following their progress from inside a warm bar, occasionally collecting betting slips and examining the runners and riders on the paper; meanwhile, a surprising speech from a track-side water tank caused quite a hurdle in the race.
In March, I decided to take a stroll to the roll-and-pineapple course where I stood near the goldfish pond to eat my jacket potato, tied with a thread, and then used my equipment - a pan, knife, scissor, and a peel - to prepare it, while maintaining a clear axis in my room to stand my pottery collectibles, which of course, required me to march around with precision, occasionally needing to climb to the arch stand.
As the lady in the swimsuit lay on the dock, she saw a young boy drop his football at the backseat of a canoe; his aim was to teach his cute dog to retrieve anything, even a spoon, using it as a type of target; he didn’t push him, but stood with a nozzle and a vegetable, ready to gauge the dog's progress on a mat, eating pineapple, a clean trampoline in the lot nearby, with a swallow flying overhead.
During the concert, while a teacher was telling a joke about a sausage playing football, a customer at the back, wrapped in a blanket, made everyone laugh with a surprised jump from his seat as he tried to catch a beer can thrown by his friend; meanwhile, a kite seller on the head end of the crowd tripped over a shoe, making his chest bounce and his cellphone fly into the hands of a fisherman mapping out his next drill spot, who was startled by the sudden gong strike, and in the confusion, he sprinted off the scene on one leg, skidding under a beam of light.
"Come to the band's music festival at the market," the report read, where a distance away, an umbrella made of light would shine over the fruit cake stand, a hedge stood near the pond reflecting the glow, and the crowd, armed with a brush, a fork, and cymbals, would lie on towels, while the jarring, out-of-place sound of a mower competed with the punch of their joyful rhythms.
At the front of house, a lean cowboy, clothed in animal skin, tells a student to cook and stir the pot on the stove, before turning to pump the blower, creating a background noise for his presentation on the podium. He removes a towel from his traditional western purse, revealing a magic wand underneath, before performing a dance of strength. Taking a break, he heads towards the bathroom where he can see his skis, remnants of his former 'sle'-filled adventures, peeping from beneath a blown towel.
"On a ski course, I saw a man in a Jersey walk with a push tractor to the market, a woman draw an animal body with her eye, a gardener plant a tree in the axis of the park, a hairdresser curl a woman's hair using a scissor, a masseur doing a body massage, a hunter with a gun near a bull, all in the span of time."
In the middle of the space in front of a vibrant band stage, a pair of body-fitness instructors initiated a kick-boxing technique; one leaned over to sell a bottle of energy shake to a doctor who savored the drink, while stirring a dish of spaghetti which was served on the edge of a decorated table; at the same time, the bride was posing for a portrait near the trash bin, making a unique contrast, and suddenly the bed for the photo backdrop was visibly unoccupied.
In a short night at the club, Jean, part of the carriage club, decided to deal with his tricep issue, so he decided to flip the marker and suspend his weekly class, he'd smash a plate, cast down his car keys and tell everyone in the audience that he's off to the playground to enjoy a game of score throwing, and they would later discuss it.
As a golfer took a stroll, observing a sheep on the ground, a sudden flash diverted his attention to a body worker skillfully demonstrating how to drill a collar onto a small tricycle, while a group of children busily dribbled a ball and took turns in jumping over a television; nearby, a waitress smoothly sliced a hamburger and sprayed soap on a bowl to sink it in; coupled with the sound, the click of a button on her apron played a melodic song making the scenario seem surreal, whereas a herder sat quietly under a tree reading a book.
At the start of the bizarre game, I was on my motorcycle, sipping juice extracted from a vegetable through a hose, with part of a magic wand hanging from my wheel, when a stray ski slid across the lawn only to crash into the calf of a man using a keyboard on the base of a giant chess mask. Suddenly, I had to dive into a hole, removing my shoe to shake the paint from it while a racket and a sun-decorated hookah were revealed from under it.
In the rip-roaring bull dance at the county fair, the pressure was mounting as I watched, sipping cool water with a wool jersey suit on, cellphone shifting in my pocket as I rested on a cart, a house fly casually braiding its way across the roof of the makeshift dance hall, my mind trailing off to the forgotten dryer back at my house, as my mouth was dry, waiting for the rest of my team to show up.
At the market place on the hill, a lady with a sword hanging on her chest, separated from the group, used a rope and squeegee to pitch a log up the ladder against her house, right next to a stove; meanwhile, she saw a man chew a coin and solve a presentation on a net, while keeping an eyeglass on a leash, against the background of a cream flag waving by the stunning waterfall, where a log lay on a plate, near a crate of eggs.
After a day of work, he decided to treat himself to a grilled sausage on a bench by the cliff, enjoying the light breeze; suddenly, he saw a crowd dribble a football towards a bench where surprise objects lay: a flute, a bow, a balloon, and a cup, bringing him joy as he chewed on his meal, the song from a nearby car drifting from its open backseat; as he waited for the spectacle to wind down, he slowly pulled his cart filled with boards from his garage, past the hurdle to mow his lawn, ultimately planning to roll a relaxing bath, light a massage candle in his bathtub before retiring.
The male teacher, with a puzzled look, had to sew the torn banner that hung from the school's playground, while the portrait of him playing the piano, holding an axe, fell from his purse which he placed on the yard; he later discovered that the banner was cleaner than before, as if it was washed, dried and ironed in a dryer, yet it still smelled of forest oil and the salty beach; the report mentioned an unusual incident of him blowing bubbles near a stone pool.
At the end of a peculiar ceremony in the country, an engage chef painted an orange branch on his face as a target, while his costume, which consisted of a gym outfit with a razor pin on the shoulder, lay folded on the ground next to the backseat of his locked car; having slipped on vomit, he decided to dive onto his leash, stretch his arms wide, and retrieve his outfit with an unexpected grace.
The individual artist, often a bartender at night, drew a line of peace between a soldier dressed like a bird and a goldfish in a collar, a dog wearing a tooth necklace, and a snake ready to leap; while close by, a hat-adorned child about to dunk a cube of dice into a dish of yolk, briefly shifts down to insert a button into the sleigh's fabric, amused by the unique scene.
In the short room, with a concrete counter, I sit on a stool, a cup of paint next to me, and receive the object—a unicycle—that direct its way through the air under the cheers of a bird trying to help a fish caught in a microphone wire while near the pile of vomit, a part of a flag and a toothbrush lay on a plate, a dryer nearby giving off gauges of heat, all under the bright light of a candle, and amidst all this absurdity, I swing the air with my hand, ready to sail through this bizarre tableau.
In the middle of the short driveway, the silhouette of a policeman covered in a groom-style suit aimed to mow the grass, while keeping an eye on a snake creeping towards the arena; his key goal was to give a spark to the competition involving a pond, a beam, and dry equipment, with a crucial ingredient being to carefully pump gas up the slope to prevent any mishaps.
As a patient vendor, Cain sold an assorted mix that contained everything from a rock sharpening technique for fostering pet goldfish, to a scooter-modeled toy alligator, which his employee explained to a bride holding a box of darts, a kite, and a braid of rope on the roof of the arena where she was stretched down on a couch under her future husband's rain-soaked skate; while at the top of the roof, a group of children were busy playing a hoop with their newly purchased solidified drink, a pseudo-mortar-and-pestle shaped like a racket, to hoop down the drink.
At the event, I watched a man teach how to juggle a bowl, a mitt, and a toy gun, right on the beach, with an excited animal —a playful camel, on a leash— near him; youngsters were spraying their beverages around, cheering for him; just behind a painted wall, there was a field where people raced their boats and some tried to stretch on a trampoline; as the night fell, by the glow of sleigh lights, the same man began a game of 'hunt the arrow' on the nearby playground, making a deal with the kids that whoever found the arrow would get to ride the sleigh; sadly, a kid playing wound up with a punch and fell on the couch; nevertheless, everybody enjoyed that unique spectacle that day.
At lunch, the cowboy soldier shared a joke about tossing a frisbee, then with a swift hit, sent a bull puff racing across the snow filled rink; meanwhile, a player adjusts the gauge on his tank, sitting on his mat, designing a lace-patterned glass as he fed his muscles a massage, specifically targeting his triceps, despite the descriptive pierce of pain, while the band played on a table nearby, creating an unusual, yet entertaining desert spectacle.
The owner decided to end his indoor tour at the pottery gallery where a stone-colored scooter stood; its number, AXIS-007, inscribed in mascaras' beat. He served a cream hamburger on a plate while an amateur guitarist strummed, stepping away to adjust a wool bubble blower on a ladder. To his left, figurines with delicate wing details made with cream, and on his right, vivid color wool decor showcasing a unique blend of hamburger, ladder, and stone themes.
At the park, the owner of a famous duck performer, known for his drumming routine, was in a separate room, blowing candle beams from a fry-shaped birthday cake, while a worker inhaled a cigarette, standing by the river's edge; he watched with amusement how a basketball player tried to ride a bike with a bowl of bird food on his shoulder, delighting at the sight of an occasional spark when the player would suck on his popsicle stick too quickly and accidentally smash into the yard's fence.
In a forest draped with various hues of color, a mother, attired with a short blue dress, was engaged in a presentation on her pumpkin surgery at the podium, while the sheep and the horse from her audience patiently laid on a pile of log; nearby, the axe, sharpener, and mower were suspended from a branch, and a few yards away, a water pump hummed in rhythm to the drop of rain, temporarily silencing the ear from the continuous trumpet of a racket; she picked up her speech from the last page she read aloud, blown away by a wind wave which swam in air inducing an engaging suspense, while her son was busy sharpening his ear's listening skill and trimming the grass with a mower in the meadow – a chore his mother instilled in him since he was a child.
The officer with a chip on his shoulder looked over at the motorcycle near the sink, as the gymnast, a well-respected athlete, was ready to raise the football and start the game; his cellphone, dinner in a bag, and other equipment kept beside him. His decision to remove a tank of oil and replace it didn't sit well with everyone, but he loved to do stuff differently. Afterward, he decided to surf the web, read a book under the shine of a lamp, and pop open a can of liquid energy drink, flapping his pages nonchalantly.
The guitarist, on his way to celebrate at the restaurant, had to hold his cat in the driveway, making sure it wouldn't run towards the crosswalk; meanwhile, in the adjacent park, some folks celebrated with beer at a building where a large portrait of a peeler was hung, and others played with a puck and a frisbee near a cliff, where someone had left a seat; in the meanwhile, the town's biggest fish was over the shoulder, casting a large beam.
At the pig farm, nestled in a pit carved by an old axis, a silhouette of a carriage left by the previous owners was faintly visible, where farmer Bob used to play football before attempting to sing at the local gym's talent show; nearby, kids were dropping tags into a pitcher that held the goldfish won at the fair, while in the distance, a snowmobile turned back and forth, its blower making bubbles in the snow; inside the main house, on a worn-out, wobbly table, there sat a cup shaped like a gun and a barber's precious wine bottle from his first haircut.
At the world peace conference, a surfer with a hockey tie stopped to tie his skateboard to a stool, turned to plant a bunch of flowers at the stage, protecting the pose of his dinner suit; on one hand was a weld mark from mowing, on the other a bunch of yarn was braided into a tennis net, which he used to smash a ball with his toe; all this while a skater, who was knitting a swimsuit with a brush, put on a performance on an axis of rotation.
After deciding to trim the burger, the golfer, who was a drummer on the side, gave the surfer a tied card, while the swim competitor stirred dye in the paint, treating the graphic on the metal screen with a needle; meanwhile, the performer stared at his shoe by the stove, all set to ride the stone wave, and mix in a colorful tie screen print.
At the rink, a frisbee catcher with a screen mask and a cigarette drooping from his lips, held a gun in one hand and a baseball bat in the other, serving customers his punch from behind a hedge while continuously chewing gum, reflecting the surrounding glass buildings beautifully; meanwhile, a cowboy attempted to lasso a rooftop sleigh, temporarily suspended above a smooth lawn ground, with onlookers using dice to gamble on his successful dive.
At night, in the gym, an individual posed for a picture holding a snake, while scrambling to stop a roller from smashing a bottle; in the same place, a smooth goldfish was bathed under an axis washer, all while a piece of a microphone served as drill that, when turned, would burn, causing observers to stare, leash in hand.
In the fall, a student forgot his cellphone on the playground, right next to the flag, as he got distracted by a snowball fight; his friend decided to stop, pick it up and made a call to him using a microphone as a part of a practical joke. The day took a turn when they decided to play a lie and walk to the guy's house to decorate his room with cream coloured wallpaper. Although interrupted by a disturbing noise from a neighbor's chainsaw, they managed to dry the newly decorated room before the guy returned. In the meantime, someone noticed a problem with the roof and had to fix it using a rub-on solution. In the rush, he accidentally locked his toothbrush in the roof, leaving it unreachable. By the time they had completed their tasks, the sun was setting and they decided to rest, surf the internet, and goggle at the unusual event where the same neighbour was trying to use his mower to cut a gigantic ice cream cone.
On a winter day, the gymnast with hair tied close, wearing a pair of mitts to brave the cold, turned down the pitch of the slope for safer climb, leashing his spirit as a diver would control their breath, looking at the mirror in the bathroom which was buck marked with graffiti, walking across the area with a mat and pushing a stool aside, he spotted a rock shaped like a peeler by the shore, nested next to a puff of cotton-like plant.
In his speech, the customer discussed the country's latest report of a score of wheelbarrow-driving lumberjacks who sell gas in the field, remove needles stuck in concrete, and roast donuts by the lake, while skateboarding hedge boarders sell dish specials according to their base clientele.
At home, my friend, a policeman with a beard, and I were set to discuss the recent speech he delivered to an audience of motorcyclists in the room; he had a unique ability to lock their attention into the subject at hand. Hanging on the wall was a painting of a birdie pitching a ball, and beneath it, a display of his police equipment - gun, drill, and a scrub that he jokingly referred to as his 'tooth scrub'. Just outside the area, a pedestrian, who was a gym-junkie, began to jog past a field with a cow and a sheep, while on his motorcycle, a tank of water strapped securely. On the porch stood a pitcher, filled with more water by a broom-wielding same pedestrian posing with waxed enthusiasm. Over the murmuring of discussion, we could still hear the distinct hum of his motorcycle, an ever-familiar sound that oddly seemed to complement the breaking dawn.
At the goldfish vendor's dock, a guitarist put to background, a runner in dress recovering from toe surgery jogged on the treadmill, while a doctor eating a cupcake left wax from his birthday candle on the door of his tractor, a basketball player munched a blanket-wrapped beverage, and a roller promenaded the surgery ward with a basket of door prizes.
At dinner, the female artist and the teacher, who was also an employee of the same building, decided to give a silhouette portrait to their part-time coworker - a tricep-focused gym trainer who used to sing like a cow on karaoke nights. To celebrate the end of the shift, they ordered fish and chips, a clear drink from the faucet, and sat near the stove to avoid the sand drop from an old rope slide across the street; amid their race to finish meals, they noticed a razor-sharp board comb and a sharpener lying on the tabletop which reminded them of the unusual items often found around their workplace.
For the family event, the goal was pancake flipping on the stove, with the point to direct the pancake into a basketball hoop precision-stocked by an athlete with a broom, while the wave of a chess master used a soap-slicked, specific object to stretch a swimsuit over the bounce of each lap; meanwhile, outside on a cliff, others prepared to harness the power of gravity for the car jumping showpiece.
On a rainy day, Officer Cain, dressed in his cowboy garment and helmet, saw a female pedestrian on the beach, shaking to music; as an instructor, he quickly prepared a blanket and towel set to help her. Meanwhile, a burger sign fell in the distance causing him to fetch a sle and dig through the ice to build it back up, all while a calf, named Bride, watched – its belly filled with grain.
The pig golfer taught the sheep student how to hurdle over the razor-edged paddles, run up the steep slope, jump the skipping baton, and then run through the cheering crowd, his skin glistening from lotion, to swipe at the cymbals, the stinging wound attached to the graphic memory of the failed trick rinse; meanwhile, the razor-skipping pig decided to jump over a hurdle that was also a sheep.
During the annual fun fair in the small town, Cain, referring to a cow on a treadmill by the lake shore, admire a worker using an axe skillfully, while his tongue gently licked some leftover spaghetti, as he watches with a lot of amusement; on his left, a group of building engineers played cards, eating hamburgers, a singer strumming a guitar softly; right by the station a washer spun wildly, a wheel fell off, and a man in a swimsuit, holding a squeegee, stands next to his motorcycle on the grass, ready to start the main event of the course - a suit race.
Wearing a top with a tattoo, she carefully dice the roast on the stove using her special technique, then she walked towards the vault where she got her swimsuit, while she listened to the sound of chainsaw from the shore. She locked the vault, picked up her jacket, and pass by the stone built arena where people were dropping their rackets after a vigorous tennis match. Hitting the rock accidentally with the washer, she felt a sudden pressure, mounted her bath robe, took a punch bag, and started to train where she included the swift hit and drop movements, ready to defend her title in the top notch competition.
At the pool, a teacher called his patient pupil over, who, carrying his surfboard on his shoulder, after a massage, was busy shaking an oyster saying that it could sing. The pupil, no word of complaint, set his triangular chip on the bench, dusted off his tie, this time cleaning the trash with his flute. They both sat at the dock watching the top of the wall alongside, talking about their desires to quit smoking cigarettes, considering it as an important treat for their health.
In our family's short routine exercise, I shift from one activity to another; beginning with a leap from my white bed to wash and scrub before I feed on a tomato for breakfast, I then walk to the garage to chisel on some cardboard, take a break to spin a kite on the roof, and finally, read a book by the ocean, listening to the tag of the surf, the wave touching my arm in the peaceful serenity, all while talking about the tire we need to fix, a potential fire danger, and our plan to shoot the breeze under a warm blanket with some food.
On my birthday, the crowd of students gathered in the garage, where the policeman, taking a break from his role, swapped his whistle for a piano and began to practice a tune; nearby, the priest, in peaceful acceptance of the festival spirit, fresh out of a bike ride, shunned his traditional dress for a burger-themed towel while a blower whirred in the background to provide coolness; next to him, a makeup artist used a cream pencil to perfect the face of a volunteer, and on a side table, amidst a tangle of wires, lay a forgotten door key and a doodled-on burger-patterned notepad.
The guitarist, having slung on a goggle, attempted a daring drive by the lawn of the castle, tossing a chip-laden card into a cart and a tube of lotion onto a pole, when his goal to kissed the teacher he admired was momentarily halted by a fire; the body of the rider stood in his path while the runner, his mouth agape, stopped in his tracks, the wing of a bird fluttering above - all this seen as an item of great amusement by the castle dwellers.
At sunrise, I sat on the bench by the hedge, threading a needle to sew a patch on my goggles, while watching a peeler dance around a pile of oranges; nearby, a newspaper draped over a brick wall hinted at lands untamed and vast like a desert. Suddenly, a hookah dropped from a nearby table, its pot rolling in a chase against the sun's rays, which served a spray of golden hues; I raised my arm to prevent any damage and resumed peeling an orange with a sigh, this dance of life never ceasing.
The dancer, wearing a hat and with a paintbrush in his hand, skillfully carved a toy out of lumber using a chisel, while his pet cat watched. Nearby, a pedestrian paused to raise a flag and play a tune on his flute. In the kitchen, the stove bubbled, a fork and spoon sat near the faucet, ready to control the batter for a new recipe. A bike helmet sat on the counter, a reminder of morning's mountain adventure. Meanwhile, an intricate graphic decorated a pipe, catching everyone's eye. There was so much to look at and tell. A tricep flexed in agreement, riding a wave of shared excitement.
At the castle, the bartender decided to follow his dream to solve the mystery of the beach volleyball match number 7, where the ball seemed to spin oddly, and while doing so, he was stopped by a store manager that give him a dye for his drape; the bartender, despite his confusion, thanked the manager and continued his journey towards the building down the street near the cow pasture, but he found his path blocked by a unicycle enthusiast dribbling a basketball who took a break to rest, eat some meat sandwich with butter, and drink a beer on the station platform, staring at the clear desert through a pierced hole on his hat, who's been chased by the event audience watching the spectacle; during the turmoil, a razor-sharp piece of debris flew toward the crowd threatening to cause harm, but, quick to react, a bystander with a harness managed to swing onto the unicycle and prevent the issue while playing a harmonious tune on a flute.
The bridesmaid, close to the waterfall at the foot of the mountain, decided to wear her new paddle-board themed socks; she had to roll up her dress to wade in the water, causing a crowd of onlookers to watch and pose, imitating her unique style. While she paddled around, some spectators chose to dribble a toy basketball, and one even decided to light up a cigarette. Not too far away, there was a man reading his newspaper on a cozy bed placed on a roof, using a key to scrub off a marker stain from his favorite toy. Inside the house, someone forgotten on a treadmill struggled to lift a weighty bathtub, causing a loud noise that forced the man to set his newspaper aside and intervene.
In the bustling arena, the guitarist, dressed in a dazzling watermelon costume, took a turn, skipped a beat, and rolled the dice with a new song; before him, the bartender in his offbeat toothbrush and tooth patterned apron, served a delicately decorated cupcake, and behind him, fans clad in colorful costumes began to collect mementos. As the lights flash, the room pulsates with excitement, and he receives a tool from a fan—a unexpected blanket to resist the cool air. Drowned in the euphoric blow, he gifted the fan a puff of his natural charm, a quick kiss to celebrate the win of that unforeseen moment.
In the glow of her birthday, the silhouette of a woman held a purse in one hand, a set of books in another ready to read to her kid, a dancer, who was also an athlete with a passion for football, as they relaxed under a tree on a slope; nearby, a team of individual artists - a guitarist, a man rolling a pancake dough into shape, another shaping a donut and a woman filling the figures of a cat and a goat on a cake - continue with their work, while a roller, used to flatten the ground, rattles causing the pile of eggs to shake.
A couple, owners of a motorcycle business, felt the pressure of the competition, but still took time to gather in their brick-walled yard, while their customers shuffled and clapped to the rhythm of a piano playing from a crackling cellphone's speaker, and a duck, which the family treated as a pet, seemed to chew the tag on a broom; meanwhile, their kids played tag, trying not to trip over rocks or singe their clothes on the firepit, often stopping only to feed a clip from a nail gun into a helmet for a makeshift game of bat-the-nail, teased by elder siblings who constantly filled the air with the tingling sounds of a keyboard, their mom, having put down the cellphone, now busily sweeping, then having to suspend her work to rip a fallen leaf off her shoulder, a task made tricky because of the messiness of a helmet chewed earlier by the duck.
At dinner, the bridesmaid, an adept violin player from our country decided to stroll around, her number displayed boldly on a map. As the drummer started to spin around on his seat, she began to win the crowd's attention. With the striking ground beat of the drum, it seemed as if a vault of applause was unleashed. Interestingly, a graffiti artist had fetched a fry from the dinner table, eating it while drawing a circle on a nearby base wall with a pen. Simultaneously, the goalie aimed to hammer in the final goal, as if fishing for the ultimate victory, the insert of his achievement in the night's joyous celebrations.
At the event, the doctor, who had a routine of making a joke about every item he encountered, suspended his usual practice when he saw a machine-designed dart game in alley; to his surprise, it even had a microphone and a wave cube, unlike the typical base designs; near by was a raft, a motorcycle with a squeegee just next to it, guitars hung on the wall, a drum set in the corner, and on top of a table, a hookah, a spoon, a candle, and a pig figurine; suddenly, a loud pop from a bikini-clad woman shooting a water balloon broke the scene, eliciting laughs from the crowd.
My family was gathered around the fireplace, enjoying the game of watermelon-word puzzle, we were playing; dad was sipping his beer, giving the puzzle an intense look, while mom prepared a treat of smoked fish and grilled bronco on her trusty pan. Next to her, my older sister, a champion swimmer, sat idly peeling the ear, looking at her guitar in the mirror, and regretfully eyeing her volleyball gear in the garage since she had to sit out this game. Anticipation hung thick in the air, volunteers and victims of the competitive spirit fuelled by the playful taunts of a teammate. My baby brother, at the same time, had fallen asleep by the river, a shovel, and a plate of watermelon slices, dreaming about catching a wild fish, and sure enough reflected in the side mirror of our parked car was the bronco, steadfast as an unwavering sentinel. As for me, I sat on my bed, trying to figure out the word puzzle amidst the cheer and clatter, my eyes occasionally straying to the thick, sweet smoke wafting off the pan.
During the game, the athlete in the clean jersey took a short jog on the path, then made a run for a lap, under intense pressure but with the agility of a ski-runner; he dodged a cardboard silhouette of a giant potato, accidentally pulping a tomato in his toe, while his band played on, their tunes flowing from the garage; meanwhile, a marker rolled out from the base of a hoop, a reminder to replace a lost contact before the next slide; later in the suit room, a comb lay forgotten on the bench, next to a fitness card focused purely on triceps, as someone's tooth had formed a band around it while eating a snack.
In the driveway, the student with a tag took hold of his bicycle, close to a pile of sand, ready to dive into a new adventure, while the barber sang an award-winning song about a tomato on a mat, using a fork as a gong near the bar where an employee expertly harnessed oil as an unusual object and proceeded to lock it securely.
At the river station, the lady in an orange mask adjusted her umbrella, trimmed braid, and gauged the area, ready to step onto the skateboard and continue towards the dunk to make her bold shot from the front. She stirred in her chest, dry from the piercing anxiety wrapped in a wire. On the sideline, the man holding a microphone under the flag was ready to sew the next moment in his range of thoughts while standing on the staged board rotated on its axis.
The drummer, clad in a white garment, decided to prevent his family from competing in the land race on their horses and scooters, directing them instead to use the home's fireplace, its spark and warmth a distance from the wound he received when he tripped over a wire while attempting to perform a tie with his skateboard; meanwhile, a machine whirred in the background, and in the wing of the house, they could see his pet goat puffing away at his favourite toy, the only sound that could be heard was the rustle of dry leaves and an occasional sip from the drink at hand.
Carrying a raft on his shoulder, the dancer with a hat and a pocket full of frisbees started to chase a horse, while he took a sip from his apple juice, carefully avoiding the sidewalk pit. With a hair clip securing his hair close to his head, he managed to catch an animal that was outstretching towards his hat. With a quick stop to check the yolk of a nearby egg, he continued his stretch, dealing with the bridesmaid's deal without dropping a note, right next to a line of tires on a boat that was covered with a giant frisbee. Finally, he was able to tell her something important before he gently let the frisbee fly away.
The performer, a trick master known for his prowess with a drill, had a unique body built like a bike; his specialty was a pair of strolls on a high-wire where he would skillfully balance a couch on his head, while juggling a mat, a shoe, and a pineapple. He loved to compete with the crowd, often propelling pineapple juice onto a gleaming banner, much to their delight. After the show, he would come and sleep on that same mat, his body faintly smelling of smoked oysters. His favorite part was the morning view from his scooter of the crowd milling, their faces filled with anticipation, while he sipped on fish-spiked juice, his only reminder of his former life as a pearl diver. As a final touch, he would leave a present on each seat: a towel subtly shaped like a sleeping fish.
In the bustling market, a sheep named Cymbal settled on a couch near a dryer while listening to the chatter, observed a bunch of children fly around the counter where a woman was sewing lace onto a dish mat, while a goalie named Puck was enjoying a cupcake, eying the wires of a toilet in surprise, when suddenly a rock hit a pole near a pond, causing a marker to cast a puff of ink to prevent further mischief.
At the unusual event, the gymnast, known for his tattoo, had to apply a drop of vomit-colored hair dye, navigate a wheelbarrow race while wearing clothing layered under a wetsuit, ascend a ladder, fly through a hoop, lift a barbell with one leg, and finally do a performance in a bathtub filled with cereal and yolk, all before the priest, who was flipping a page in his prayer book near a stove, while the audience, a lot of them holding forks ready to dig into a bunch of cake slices, watched on and a man in a coat readied a new set of challenges.
The soldier tied his shoe, his headphones tucked securely against the side of his head, as the world's only dog-designed treadmill was reported to perform exceptionally, inciting a round of laughter from pedestrians; at the same time, the page featuring the detailed design of the revolutionary treadmill was topped with a cube that spun with every tap, simulating a cascading waterfall that made even the grumpiest bystander chuckle; it was a sight so entertaining that it singed itself into everyone's memory, even as a kite flew overhead, its vibrant colors drawing everyone's attention; meanwhile, the surgeon, who was performing leg surgery offline, asked for a quick update, took a drink of water, cracked a joke about a yolk, and then pointed to the screen, continuing to drive home his point.
The worker, a guitarist by heart, tossed his mask aside and amid the light rain, began to examine the battered truck parked on the concrete rink; he looked under the hood, shuffled around the wheelbarrow and cart, preparing to treat the engine like an intricate instrument, when a pitch from a pitcher nearby singed his head, causing him to drop a drum stick that he found in the background; laughing, he waved his marker towards the ocean and continued his task under the poorly lit podium, watched by a lonely washer.
The lady in the jersey jacket, who was a tourist, observed a bronco, the wild animal, near the pool adjacent to the tall building; using a needle, she tried to sweep away an eyelash stuck in her drink, meanwhile, a man started to grill near her, under the umbrella, his body leaning against the wall; down the pathway, by the room with a podium, a vehicle had stopped near a tap where a door led to another wall displaying painted bats and cymbals, a hookah, a canoe, and a dangling tie.
