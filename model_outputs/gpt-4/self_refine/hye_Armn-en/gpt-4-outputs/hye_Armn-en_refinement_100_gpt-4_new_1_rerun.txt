This not only confirms that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, a hypothesis that is already widely spread, but also provides details that fossils cannot generally provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the upper parts of this animal were grayish-brown, while the lower parts were pale or light-colored.
The movie continues to depict the development of the birds' nests.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed barbules, which are called feather vane, but have other unique features of feathers such as hollow quills and barbs, researchers have hypothesized that most likely the feather vane was a later evolutionary development than these other unique features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but more likely for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur specimen, it demonstrates a large size feather and not a down.
"Researchers hypothesize that although this is the footprint of a young dinosaur, the specimen indicates a large-scale creature and not a small-scale one."
