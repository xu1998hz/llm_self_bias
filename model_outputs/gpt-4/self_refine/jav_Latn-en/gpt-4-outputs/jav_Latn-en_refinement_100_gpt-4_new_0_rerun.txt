This is not just denying that there were dinosaurs with feathers, a theory that has been disseminated, but generally there are no fossils that can be used as evidence, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
The scientist states that this animal's fur is brown-beige on top and pale or carrot-colored on the bottom.
The mentioned discovery also guarantees insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaurs did not have well-developed feathers, called rachis, but had characteristics of other types of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers infer that rachis probably is a subsequent evolutionary development that is another characteristic.
The structure indicates that it was not used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or appearance. The research gives a hint that even though this is a dinosaur tail, samples show mature feathers and not hatchlings.
The researcher provides evidence that this is the tail of a six-year-old dinosaur, samples show mature feathers and not downy ones.
